In comparison I'd say the food was OK but some of the portions, for the money, were skimpy. Especially for the price paid.  I'd go back to Sakana before going back to Hana.

I see Sushi Chefs from other restaurants coming here to eat during their off time. =)The prices are very reasonable, and all of the rolls and sashimi are very fresh and crafted to perfection by the old timers.The Ramen Noodle Bowl is awesome, and nothing like what you would buy in the grocery store. It is topped with pork, fish cake, bamboo, and seaweed. I highly recommend.They even have a fried salmon skin roll, which was very flavorful and not always available at every establishment. I wish that i would have taken a picture of the last one that I purchased, it was absolutely perfect.They also offer Takoyaki, which is like an octopus dumpling ball. You would have no idea that it contained octopus unless you were familiar with the dish. these are absolutely amazing and highly addictive. You have to try these during your visit.The last time that I was there, I had to try the Ichigo Mochi Ice Cream. It was green tea ice cream, surrounded by a rice flour shell and topped with whipped cream. It really hit the spot and I was so full but in a happy and satisfying way.If you like Sushi, and you think that RA is cool, hit yourself on the head for being a complete fool and go check this place out and get schooled on what fresh authentic Sushi is all about. Your mouth will thank you for doing the right thing!Cheers and keep up the good work at the place.FYI... Bring your own Saki if you need booze with your meal. I say, just enjoy the good meal without alcohol and see how happy and relaxed the meal makes you feel.	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	5	2011-12-28	5	1

It's a small, cozy restaurant with tables for 3-4, for 2, and seats at the sushi bar. We ordered the vegetarian gyoza as our appetizer and two cups of miso soup. We also got the Philly roll and Las Vegas roll, and the former came out first out of all the food. I love a classic Philly roll, can't go wrong with cream cheese and salmon. The Vegas roll was okay, I'm just not a fan of the deep fried rolls. The soup was excellent, simple but satisfying. And the appetizer was pretty good as well. They brought us more pickled ginger when we asked, since we like that stuff a lot. Good service, they are fast and efficient at refilling water and clearing off empty plates. Partly because the place is so small and they were getting more customers. Once we paid our bill, we felt that we had to leave because groups of two were waiting and there were no empty tables for 2. Still a great place to check out and I liked the authentic feel of it.	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	4	2016-08-07	15	13

0	NSUjtynUgUugvjyKeGn_jw	s5LfGvGqd3ioZ7t2417WiA	Hana has been one of the restaurants in our bucket list. My husband and I had the opportunity to go here. I really wanted to like this place but just bummed and came home unhappy and unsatisfied.We ordered gyoza, ginger pork lunch bento, salmon terriyaki lunch bento and a volcano sushi. Total bill was about $39 and some change.The gyoza was actually pretty good. I wish we could have gotten 2 orders and be done with it. I had the ginger pork, I pretty much had about 8 thinly sliced bite size pork hidden within some onions and ginger. My husband had a really small salmon. The side dishes were boiled potato, okra, squash and something else - I am not sure what it is. Underwhelmed and still a bit hungry, we ordered the volcano. I'm a little disappointed as it wasn't what I am used to. The only fish I found was the fish on the very top, that's it.Overall, it was an underwhelming and unsatisfying lunch. I wish we have gone somewhere else. Not going back and can't recommend it.	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	1	2015-05-05	1	0

Small, yet intimate; creative and innovative, original and authentic WITH an AMAZING customer experience. THIS IS IT! Fish is fresh, plentiful and beautifully arranged. Bring your own wine makes this dinner down right """"cheap"""" without cheapening your night. I rarely get anything """"bold"""" (for me its the safe nigiri and sushi and roll options), but for those with a wild side, it seems they have you covered.If you plan ahead, arrange for a Shabu Shabu dish (just had that). I think its a 24 or 2 day notice, but the dish is so much fun and the beef melts (literally) in your mouth."""	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	5	2013-07-14	1	0

It's so neat that it's in our neighborhood and we can wander on over with a bottle of wine and stumble on home with full, happy bellies.	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	4	2011-07-31	1	0
0	DPitNu466172os6m0Yri1Q	12GUzI7zbF3I0fR5WPvsDw	After all the love poured out to Hana I decided to hold back my initial impression and give it another shot.  I made sure to order a wide variety of items to make sure I captured the gist what they were putting down.First up: Miso SoupVery good flavor lots of seaweed, tofu, and seasonings.2nd: Tuna TartareThinly sliced, a little smokiness, a little acidity but a bit disappointing overall.  It was lacking the pop I look for in this dish.3rd: Octopus ballsThese were interesting.  Deep fried octopus with some mayo and a light sauce.  Good flavor but the cold middle just didn't work for my palate at all.4th: Shrimp and Veggie tempuraPerfectly breaded tempura.  Light crisp and tasteful.  Only knock was the dipping sauce was too simple and plain5th: Phili RollIt's hard to make a really bad or really good Phili roll.  This was just as good as any in my book.6th: Tuna sashimiUnimpressed with the freshness, mouthfeel, and color.  Expected much better pieces from such a highly regarded sushi joint.Hana has a good ambiance.  Service started out good but kind of faded midway thru.  The price was average to high for the fare. I understand lots of people love them and as much as I wanted to be in on that love fest I'm just not one of them and I am okay with that.  As overall both visits were just okay for me.  Wasn't great...wasn't bad...just really okay.  It is hard to see me giving them a third chance unless I am really craving ok sushi...	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	3	2016-03-21	3	1
0	MFGDwMQJijNc0mHv1s_BUQ	gWWFG6AcxKb8NIC_KA3a6g	I had a craving for sushi and a friend who wanted to try this place because a friend of his is a chef here.  It was the perfect combination!  Since it was a Friday night I suggested we get there early-ish to try and get a table quickly so we arrived around 5:30.  The place is pretty small so most of the tables were full but we managed to get seated right away.My friend decided that he was going to order everything  so I knew dinner was definitely not going to be some Philly rolls and fried rice.  We started out with seaweed salad which I actually really liked.  The flavor was really good with the sesame seeds and some lemon.  Next was the sushi, we had the Alaskan roll, Spicy Tuna, Volcano roll and some Sea Bass nigiri.  The Alaskan and Spicy Tuna were good, the Volcano roll was awesome with it's spicy sauce nicely crusted on top and the Sea Bass was simple and delicious.After that it was time for me to try Oysters for the first time.  Personally I wasn't a big fan but that has nothing to do with Hana and everything to do with just my personal preference.  I could tell the quality was good and they didn't taste gross, I just discovered that Oysters aren't my thing.Now at this point we were pretty full but the chef my friend knew walked by and told him to get the Razor Clams and/or the Tako Karaage.  Neither of us knew what the second one was so we asked and discovered it was fried octopus head.  As soon as he told us that I knew that's what my friend was going to order.  I'll admit I was a little nervous because I was picturing something with eyeballs coming out onto the table.  Luckily when they brought it to the table it was cut into strips so it looked completely harmless.  We drizzled some lemon over it, took a deep breath and took a bite.  After about 2 seconds we looked at each other in amazement because it was DELICIOUS!!!  I'm talking so good my mouth is watering just remembering it right now.  Octopus has a tendency to get chewy but this had a texture like steak!  The flavor of it was amazing as well.  The lemon juice gave it just the right balance of citrus and whatever they marinated it in before frying it was perfect.  Definitely the highlight of the meal.For desert we asked the waitress for her recommendation and she suggested the Hana An Mitsu which is aloe vera with fruit and red bean paste.  I wasn't quite sure about eating aloe vera as I associate it with putting it on my skin for a sun burn but we decided to continue our adventure of trying new things and get it.  It came out almost like a soup, there were big chunks of the aloe, a couple strawberries, some mandarin oranges and the chunky red bean paste all in a liquid of some kind.  Neither of us were really big fans, the aloe chunks were just too big and overpowered the rest of it.  Overall though the meal was one of the best I've had.  The quality and flavors of the food was excellent.	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	5	2013-07-16	3	0
4	M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA	K7P3DLZ_mWtxjCqb318_jw	Ate here months ago.  Was excited to finally find a Phoenix sushi venue, and one that also offered brown rice as a sub for sushi dishes (don't quote me on this however, since it has been many months and I may be recalling another venue).  One item did impress me, and that was the complimentary appetizer that was comprised of tempura'd chips with perhaps a squid salad topping (?)  I should have just ordered another serving of this!  Instead, I tried an Ao Yasai (mixed gourmet greens with ginger) and a sushi roll w/ brown rice, the latter I thought was price-y considering the very small portion given.  I was so unimpressed by its unexciting flavors that I don't even recall what kind of roll I tried!  Pretty sad, I know.  I told myself I wouldn't go back, but I would like to give Hana another try, perhaps for lunch and/or dinner with a group of friends and have apps and wine/sake!

The amaebi was especially  memorable.A touch on the pricy side, but it was worthwhile.Actually pricing is odd.. i've seen amaebi for $10+/2 pieces, it's $6 here.but Aji is like $5.50/2 pieces in seattle is like $10 here. must be due to fish availability..

Everytime I've gone, the staff has been super friendly and the sushi is terrific.  When it first opened, they used to bring out all sushi orders on those big boats, which I found kinda funny because sometimes there would only be two orders on there but they'd still make a huge presentation out of it.They don't seem to do that anymore, at least not with the smaller orders.  I kinda miss that.  Maybe they don't have enough boats or something.  ;)	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	5	2008-06-17	5	3

Surprisingly, a lot of locals are unaware of this gem. I feel like people want to keep it a secret because it's just that good! I recommend Hana to everyone asking for sushi recommendations. I've been to Hana dozens of times and have spent 3 birthdays there. I always order the volcano roll no matter what. It's so delicious. Baked to perfection! The spicy tuna roll is delicious as well. Honestly, anything on the menu is great. The staff is always helpful and they never get annoyed even after asking a millllion questions. I love visiting Hana. The one thing I truly miss in Phoenix.

Brought an extremely picky foodie friend visiting and he loved this place.  Loved the dumplings, toro sashimi, yellowtail sashimi and mackarel sashimi.  What I didn't realize the last time I ate here when I spouted off about limited sushi selection, is that they have several sushi specials which more or less doubles their offerings.  New favorite sushi place.  Seriously, get over there!	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	5	2010-05-03	1	2

The location of Hana is perfect and parking can be found quite easily.  ** Just an fyi - They have recently applied for a Liquor License and we were informed that during the process, they are not permitted to be a BYOB business.The sushi is always fresh, good portions and attentive service from everyone.  Go early or later to avoid standing around watching everyone eat.  They do have a small outdoor patio, it was too cold for us though.	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	4	2013-12-12	3	1

The chefs and staff are great at what they do.  Hana uses fresh garnishes that I haven't seen in other sushi bars in town.  Pickled wasabi is one of them.  They accent with little ingredients  that make the food and presentation so much better and interesting.The fish is out of this world.  We give chef Kojisan the option to create a dinner for us (my partner and I) and what comes out from behind that bar is natural goodness enhanced by a master's creative touch.They know us at Hana.  We get the rockstar treatment along with good suggestions and samples of something new on the menu.  We are usually blown away.We had the ramen noodles last night for the fist time.  Wow!!!  That pork was incredible.  For the first time we tried the Kobe beef sashimi.  Not bad.  Not bad.The staff at Hana are super friendly.  They are always wearing smiles in that busy atmosphere.  There are seldom new faces within the staff.  The employees stick around.  It must be a great place to work.  It is a fun environment.Hana does it right.  In all aspects.

0	5OoLuhH-ZHIre7VHGOPzbw	fdmr-zp6djodxSo5KTJqhQ	I had such a great time at this place both times i went.  The first visit was a sushi dinner extravaganza with my sister.  The place was literally a 10 minute walk from my childhood home, where my parents still live, which was the first bonus for this place.  Once i walked in my excitement grew.  The place was small and intimate although a bit on the hot side.  Our waitress spoke with a heavy japanese accent and she was very friendly.  We ordered a bunch of rolls, they have a fairly small selection of rolls which is fine with me, and some nigiri.  They even had Uni!  i dont know how it is in phoenix but i live in Salt Lake City and Uni is incredibly hard to find there for some unknown reason.  Anyways the sushi was well prepared and tasted very fresh.  Their yellowfin was just amazing!My next visit was a lunch with my mother a few days later and we ate mostly non-sushi offerings which were also very good.  I had yakisoba which was delicious and my mother had the bento box with teriyaki steak which was also fantastic.  This place is a real gem and for me personally the location is perfect.

Pretty boring order consisting of a california roll, a spicy tuna roll, and a squid salad ( so it should have been hard to screw up, right?).  The California roll, was just crab and cucumber....no avocado, which was really odd to me. It wasn't bad, just missing avocado. Rice is a good consistency. The spicy tuna was rancid....gross, plus I paid $8.00 for something I couldn't eat. And then the squid salad tasted off....and this is something I eat for lunch at least twice a week from this little japanese market, so I know my squid salad.  We ended up throwing everything out. It's obvious our first time will be our last.	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	2	2011-10-19	1	0

Their presentation is very good, always very friendly. The only problem I would say is that its so small. If the people that sat down in the table bext to you are too loud then you might not enoy your meal so much. Its like your part of their conversation now, and of course you might be waiting for a while. They should really think about opening a bigger location.	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	3	2013-11-12	0	0

9	MfxdEmaH-0_ITpuXU4Hgzg	0iVIvJyTQfPCkBXII7kE8g	Recently we hit up the sushi bar with Kiltlifter in tow to indulge in some Japanese Wagyu beef. I caught a tweet about it and just could not resist. It was insanely good as you might imagine. A quick kiss over hot coals on your own personal chimney and grate, and I mean lightening fast to avoid over cooking the exquisitely marbled meat. Just a slight dip in the house made (yuzu?) flavored sauce it was very tasty indeed. Silky smooth fatty meaty five star territory goodness, yum. It became somewhat comical when other patrons got in on the fun as the joint filled with smoke from the fat hitting the hot coals. Some folks were just not meant to have this responsibility. Way too many people dead set on annihilating  this premium beef by over cooking these wafer thin morsels. They most definitely needed professional  supervision. Maybe at the very least you should be required to complete a simple questionnaire before they turn you loose on the good stuff.The heathens that we are we did somewhat of a surf and turf type dealio. We ordered several pieces of nigiri which we let the chef choose. No qualms about the fish quality, but I found some of the pieces were just too heavy handed with the crispy garlic tidbits. I love garlic, but this just overpowered some of the fish. Totally over gilded the lily, let the fish shine!So if you are not following on twitter, get on it!

1	lX1Pvn_AgD9fUffPsioeVw	OoEbaXT_5aFgEygfnNvWdQ	I've tried a lot of sushi places in Phoenix and I can confidently say that this is the best. While the menu is limited, they quality of the fish is the best that you can imagine in the desert. We ordered multiple types of nigiri and I think that overall the fish quality is good, but they need to work on their seasoning. The rice had such a faint vinegar taste, that with any strong fish, you couldn't even tell it was there. The fish slices were also not seasoned at all. I typically try a piece just as is to taste for quality and seasoning, but this was one of the first times, I really felt like I needed to add soy sauce and wasabi to all the fish slices.  In addition, we ordered the sake steamed clams, the gyudon nabe and okonomiyaki. The sake steamed clams were excellent but we had to send the first one back due to them having way to much sand in them. The gyudon nabe was amazing! very savory with a light sweetness and very hot and filling on a cold night! Okonomiyaki was okay at best. My bf is a huge fan of okonomiyaki and this was made way to thick and wasn't very seasoned as well. The service was also extremely attentive and friendly. The employees there were very helpful with suggestions (sometimes too helpful) and just very friendly to talk too. I will def be back, and I wish they were closure to where I lived because its kinda of a drive to get here. Amazing sushi, prices are a little higher but its the best in a desert so its worth it!

I wanted to put my two cents in that it was extremely over priced and the katsu was really really dry. As an example it was dryer than when i wake up after sleeping with my mouth open in Phoenix.Definitly sat in awkward silence for awhile though... :\  good thing we had a gift card to this place...cause i would be upset if i had to pay that much for this place and recieved poor quality food like that... Definitly not going back again...unless it is free.	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	2	2009-02-05	1	0
0	h2KVxcdzCYZ0ZBCUQQaB6Q	oh1cfEg__o8G3q4rHiFBVg	1.  Got off to a bad start--tried to call but their phone only has an answer machine. No Email contact either.  Hard place to find.  Bad location and dumpy outside.  I never would have gone in unless I had not seen them on yelp.   Small--has less than 12 tables although  bar stools as well.2.  This place has more employees than customers, so finding service is no problem.   With the high  prices they charge there is enough money to  hire.  One order of sushi and one chicken balls for $20.  But you wouldn't pay any less in Snottsdale, and the food was first rate  and  you can bring your own booze, which cuts the bill down.3.  NOTE:  they don't take reservations but this place is always packed. 8:30 on a slow weeknight, and few seats available.  I will be going back, but not on a busy weekend.4.  Also--I have been around a while and can spot a gay/lesbian hangout a mile away. This is one of them--could tell by the male ear fashion and  Hillary butch haircuts. Not that I care but if you do you might not like it here.  My guess was correct for when i was leaving I saw a bunch of gay magazines in a rack.  LOL	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	4	2016-01-08	0	0
0	e_Rmm18fK11D9-2_uzd4XQ	NUXYmS3PsMe2RmOPZYgAHQ	I will always base my opinion of a sushi restaurant according to the freshness and taste of the saba mackerel sushi. Theirs is DIVINE. I mean, it was melting in my mouth. Sometimes you forget how REALLY fresh fish tastes because you live in the desert. Hana will remind you.It's pricier than some other places, but their menu is extensive and their specials are always changing. Expect about $20-30+ a person, unless you order off the lunch/dinner menu only... but why go to a sushi bar without ordering said specialty.	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	5	2013-09-19	1	1
0	z4ZeCkjusZylNPzbodeR1Q	N6lRgXgbli4Y-K1mxvn9xA	A bit of good and bad all around -- expensive in comparison, but authentic Japanese food. Huge portions. Wifey has a tiny stomach capacity so we brought much of it home.She took a very long time to decide due to the high prices, and we almost left, when she decided on the ribeye. A good choice, the steak was amazing and full of awesome flavor.Though a bento box or a few rolls would have been nice, I chose tonkatsu ramen and it was good with lots of delightful goodies in the broth.For drinks, though they don't serve alcohol you can BYOB. I asked for hot tea, and got a can of green tea soda and cup of ice.I ordered seaweed salad, and was brought a lettuce side salad followed by the one I ordered. Next an oyster shooter. It was $9 for one presented in a small dark bowl which arrived the same time as the main course, I paused a bit, being used to seeing them viewable in a clear shot glass. Nevertheless it was tasty.On to the service: Before entering the restaurant we were greeted then seated quickly. Parking was surprisingly plentiful given the small lot, we lucked out and got a place near the door. Quite attentive wait and sushibar staff, all appropriate pleasantries spoken in Japanese, respectful and honoring us.Though the room temperature was uncomfortably hot, overall nice experience.We're on a budget so could not splurge on things we really wanted to try. Would return again at a less busy time with lower prices and less heat.	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	4	2016-07-02	1	0

Is not anything special but allows for a little more room than other similar sushi places. The staff was wire helpful and the hot tea was really tasty.  The only drawback is that is a little pricey.

5	J1yNYAjojpD_KpocG-W3KQ	myu1xuDSRLTlsDfLzm_KYw	One of these days I will learn NOT to take out of town guests to places I haven't tried first.  I was pretty excited for one of my favorite people to come and visit.  Her only request?  Sushi!  While I have my list of absolute AZ favorites (Tokyo Lobby, Toyama, Sakana, Hiro, Dozo) foolishly I decided we should try somewhere new.  Having read many good things about Hana, the choice was made.Walking into the BYOB place with our Kirin Ichiban in hand, we were ready for a great evening.  Too bad that isn't what we experienced.  After being ignored for a few minutes by everyone who passed by and even the person behind the counter, I found someone to tell that there were two of us and we would like to sit at the sushi bar.  Although there were spots open, we were left standing there for quite a while.  Do you want to stand around holding a 6-pack and not even be offered a bottle opener?  Me neither.  Once we were finally seated, we weren't told about any specials, offered water or even glasses for our beer.  Deciding to make the best of it, we ordered:Yellowtail sashimi (good, the best item we had)Spicy scallop nigiri (good)Albacore sashimi (dry, not sliced through, leaving us top pick off overcooked bits and pieces)Freshwater eel nigiri (dry and crumbly rice, falling apart at the touch)Scallop dynamite ($15+ for 'krab'?  Really?)The female sushi chef was nice but our waitress was nonexistent.  Other tables and customers at the sushi bar seemed to be getting decent service (water, getting their beer/wine/whatever from the refrigerator) but we were left without water refills (once we finally got any at all) and don't even think about getting another of those BYOB beers we brought.  It even took a while to get the unused bottles back when we were trying to leave. Lackluster food and nonexistent service at a premium price.  No thanks.	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	2	2011-07-02	5	2

You can bring your own wine or beer. A few of my favorites are the cold soba noodles, the Hamachi Kama and anything with Uni. They have the most fresh Uni I've had in the desert. The nimono is also really delicious and different that other types of tsukemono or nimono I've had before. I always leave Hana with a smile.	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	5	2014-12-08	2	1

0	sjWvk3DZapZ-9ULAFtDmYw	I9o1NqL7eeUd-76qfWJgnw	Used to love this place, and still think very highly of the food, but the recent emergence of awful attitudes from the owners and staff has put them in the back seat. Make no mistake, it is the best sushi in town, and Koji-San is the best chef, but everything else about it stinks. The wait staff is surly, and nobody could care less if you were actually in the restaurant. It is a BYOB, which I kind of like, but only if I can stop by AJ's and get a nice bottle of Sake or Shochu before hand. I recommend the ahi as it is always super fresh, and the mackerel is served in an extremely unique fashion. Nothing like looking something in the eye while you eat it.

I went for the first time on 2/15/2013 for dinner with my husband based on the reviews I read here and elsewhere that this place was really great and was craving some awesome sushi. When we pulled up I was a little disappointed as it is kind of in a strip mall area that I am not familiar with. However, after eating the food, the place could be in the middle of a landfill for all I care. We had the Hana Pride roll, uni shooters, japanese mint leaves stuffed with tuna, a yellowtail roll, an order of tuna nigiri and the tuna tataki roll. We also split their ribeye steak with shrimp. I was amazed by how fresh and delicious the sushi was. Really interesting choices that were all different but each delicious in their own way. I highly recommend the Hana Pride even though it is one of the pricier menu options because it is really awesome and totally worth the money. Besides, BYOB saves you a lot. The only thing that we could have done without was the steak, not that there was anything wrong with it. The sushi was just so good that the steak was outshined. Service was also impeccable! They refrigerated our beers and sake and were great at clearing the plates on our very small table. Can't wait to go back!	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	5	2013-02-22	1	0

We eat there several times a month and every time it is first rate.It is small yet accommodating. The seafood is as fresh as it gets in The Valley of the Sun. The menu variety makes you feel like you are actually in Japan. My favorite is the green mussels. Even for the unadventurous they are a must try.We have always had friendly, welcoming service. After a long day at work it is so nice to take our own bottle of wine and have the wonderful staff take such good care of us and treat us like family.Stop overpaying for priced sushi and Japanese food that is served at a mediocre chain.

0	jwfOpCgeob0itikBIfPi2Q	ARRfLSUS2uqIyYBRZ7apRg	The sushi is ok-good, not worthy of a 4 or 5 and if you're OK with crowded, noisy, bustling places then Hana is for you.  The staff is very nice and will be as accommodating as they possibly can. It is BYOB and they will keep your drinks chilled for you. However, it is not the perfect spot for an intimate dinner or first date. You will find yourself muffling your ears and trying to compete with the noise level from every table in the room. Unfortunately my party was seated next to a large table of inconsiderate, obnoxious, cackling chicks who for some reason felt the need to constantly scream WOO HOOO throughout the entire evening. Don't get me wrong I love seeing people have a great time but this was not cool at all. My ears are still ringing from all the screeching. So here is the low-down on what we had:Tempura - 2+  Bland at bestSquid Salad -  3+ Shrimp Tempura Roll - 3, Fell apart and gummySpicy Tuna - 3, so so.. Lacked the burn that I'm used toVolcano Roll - 2, Gobs of mayo.. Gag!Baked Green Muscle - 5+ very good.I just wish the Sushi was great enough for me to overlook all this petty crap but it just wasn't. Sorry.	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	3	2008-08-16	10	8

At first glance, it doesn't look like much and out of all places a sushi joint is here!  Needless to say once you walk in the place is cozy with a hip mom & pop feel.  It's definitely dark in here, but that lounge cool feel is hot right now so I can't complain.  I'm not a big sushi eater, but my friend ordered some and thought it was pretty good.  I'll have to agree since I only took one bite.  What I ordered was amazing!  Ebi Yakisoba noodles they served here was wonderful.  There was something about the sauce that they mixed.  I asked the waitress, but apparently its chef secret.  That extra sweet after taste left in my mouth is unforgettable, but I can only say it's similar to a kimchi sweetness without the spice.  Definitely one of the best yakisobas I had in a while and that's what's going to keep me coming back since I can't figure out what's in that sauce!  Darn the food gods!

They have a big selection, including duck, chow fun, even some Thai stuff, etc.I got the orange chicken combo and it was quite good, it was spicy and orangey and didn't taste quite the same as everyone elses' typical recipes.

I like how when I order a shrimp dish they give me 12-13 pieces compared to other places that will give you maybe 5 or 6 and cut in half. Really good bang for your buck. I will say though I always used to order the Roast Duck and it seems like they changed the flavor or cook and it's just not the same anymore. They used to serve it in the sauce and now the sauce comes served on the side, just doesn't taste as flavorful.

0	977jwJDtl9rc9s-pLuTllA	vg9FJ3LRFM1pEkgl67Bzmg	"""This is a serviceable, but not exciting, Americanized Chinese restaurant. Unfortunately, it is about the best you can do for Chinese food in the Avondale/Goodyear area.My wife and I ordered the orange chicken meal, the Mongolian beef meal, and a small hot and sour soup. The meals seem to be a good deal to add several extras to an entrée for only a dollar or so. Choosing the meal upgrade trades out your white rice from the standard entrée for some lo mein noodles and some fried rice. In addition, you get a single vegetable eggroll and a single fried cheese puff. These extras add volume and variety to your meal without being particularly interesting or delicious. From a food-volume-for-price perspective, it is a good deal, but you shouldn't expect any of the extras to be special. The eggroll in particular was extremely subpar, As it reminded me of an eggroll I could have bought frozen and cooked at my own home. The cheese puff was delicious, but then again it's difficult to screw up fried dough with a lump of cream cheese in the middle. The """"fried rice"""" really looks to be nothing more then some rice which was made brown by some kind of unremarkable sauce. The lo mein was similarly disappointing, there was very little to it other than noodles and some sauce, although the sauce did add a nice flavor. The hot and sour soup was one of the high points, as the broth was a deep rich brown with a little bit of thickness to it, it had a generous amounts of tofu cabbage mushrooms etc. and the hot and sour flavors were nicely balanced.My wife's orange chicken was tasty, but literally included nothing other than the chicken and the sauce. It did not even include the standard steamed broccoli to add a little bit of vegetable into the meal. There wasn't even the pretense of adding something healthy here, and the vegetables were sorely missed. The Mongolian beef was quite delicious but similarly unhealthy. It consisted of reasonably tender chunks of beef extremely large amount of sauce, and green onions along with slices of regular onion which had been stirfried with the beef. From my experience this is pretty much par for the course when it comes to Mongolian beef.My biggest complaint about the restaurant was the lack of variety on the menu. They were probably only about 10 different beef dishes, a handful of vegetable dishes, seven or eight seafood dishes, and the same number of chicken dishes. I couldn't find a single item on the menu with eggplant in it. What kind of a Chinese restaurant doesn't have eggplant and beef on the menu? There were a handful of Chinese/Thai offerings, but as someone who greatly enjoys Thai food, I would never risk ordering even a simple curry from a restaurant like this.So long as you're expecting cheap Americanized Chinese food, you will get what you pay for. I can see us returning to this restaurant for that purpose at some point, but not often. Make sure what you like to order is on the menu before going, because even certain standard offerings maybe missing."""	n8KZA9G4FvGqDBWIscpz9Q	3	2015-12-05	0	0

This made for a slightly uncomfortable setting.  Besides the temperature, I loved the place.  Seemed like a mom and pop shop which I always like.  So lets change it up and  talk food.  Wow....  It was tasty!  Got the Papa a La Huancaina for an appetizer and it was amazing.  I was disappointed at first because it looked so plain, just boiled potatoes cut in half smothered in a sauce.  However, after that first bite I was hooked.  These were amazing.  Got a couple of their drinks, and they were pretty tasty as well, however I wouldn't get those again.  My wife got Tallarines Verdes and it was amazing.  The pasta was a great pesto green color, which had initially concerned me it would have too strong of a pesto flavor.  It did not.  The pasta was actually nice and creamy with a perfect amount of flavor.  I got the Ceviche Mixto.  This was outstanding.  The assortment of seafood was great, the presentation was pretty, and the sauce was amazing.  Packed full of a nice lime-kick with some spice.  The waiter talked me out of going 'spicy' and went for 'medium' instead, which was probably a good idea.  Medium had a nice amount of spice that built up, but was never too spicy to ruin or mask flavors.  I would love to go back and try some other options the food was very good.	lCd20nDS9rFHW_2KViqWUA	4	2014-06-08	0	0

We sat at the bar and I enjoyed a great Argentinian red wine while my husband drank a Spanish lager. Both were delicious. After our meal the Owner stopped over to ask how it was. We talked for a long time and his wife came out from the kitchen to say hello as well. Super super sweet couple. We will definitely be back.

El Chullo is your spot! go here and you totally won't regret it one bit!!!! ordered:*Lomo Saltado-YUM! flavorful. one of their most popular items at el chullo. i definitely didn't want to stop eating this! everything was very well seasoned and the beef strips were cooked perfectly. the tomatoes were very flavorful as well! *arroz con pollo- this was recommended to me by the staff. which i thought was pretty good. the rice was flavorful and the sauce that came with it was very unique. for my first time having arroz con pollo i was definitely left with a good impression and would definitely try to order this at other peruvian places. overall, staff is really nice. the bittersweet part about coming here is you're hungry you gotta wait quite awhile for your food because they make it fresh. it's like i like the idea of it being made fresh but the wait is long for the food. also they don't have the spicy dipping sauce i've had at other Peruvian food places that you eat with bread. they however give you these unpopped popcorn kernel thing that is lightly salted. personally i didn't care for it.  tips:*small front of store parking lot.*cash and credit cards accepted*they post a lot of their food on instagram*serves alcohol.*they have a few TVs.*indoor seating only. *not super ideal for large parties since it's a small little mom and pops place.	lCd20nDS9rFHW_2KViqWUA	4	2015-04-19	1	0

The ambiance, the people, the fact that a mother and father along with their two sons run this place was a huge plus for me.

We were charged $7 extra  to replace the chicken with meet for the arroz chaufa. I have never spent $20 on just arroz chaufa. Lomo saltado was little salty and around $17  we are visiting from Los Angeles and maybe we are just spoiled but there's a big difference. FYI the explanation for the extra charge was that they use sirloin!!! Well in Los Angeles they use Fillet Mignon!Also if you get a chance to sit at the bar facing the kitchen you might be disappointed that most of there food is microwaved.	lCd20nDS9rFHW_2KViqWUA	2	2017-03-05	2	0

0	xQEOcgW2aO08GXwH09KrVA	bH9V9mHTWjzEPurTCprI4g	The reason I rated it ok was due to the service.  The food was excellent.  It is a small restaurant and we went on a Friday evening (myself and another person) We were told we would have to sit at the bar because the tables for 4 people were being held for people of 3 or more. the bar is right at the front door so I didn't feel comfortable sitting there. I spotted an empty table for two near the window and asked if we could sit there. We would told yes (why she didn't ask us if we wanted that table in the beginning, I don't know). We were given menus and ordered our food with just water for beverage. It does take a while for the food to come but the portions are good and the food was delicious. I had the ESCABECHE DE POLLO (chicken garnished with sautéed red onion, aji amarillo, aji panca, & vinegar), my partner had the ARROZ CON POLLO (Cilantro based green rice with veggies, & chicken). The waitress never came back to refill our water or check on us. Customer service is big with me and even though the food was excellent, I'd have to rethink going back.	lCd20nDS9rFHW_2KViqWUA	3	2015-12-04	0	0

I can't pronounce the names of each of the entrees, but I have to say that they were very well prepared and presented. All of the food we had was just excellent. They weren't too spicy and artfully presented. They also serve Peruvian drinks. The waitress was very kind and able to explain each of the dishes, and each was delicious. Joining us this week were my daughter and her husband who is Chilean/Peruvian - so we had a subject matter expert. The Jolly Diners rated El Chullo a 3.5 out of 5. The decor is nice, parking is a bit challenging, but worth it because the food tastes great and is reasonably priced.If you like to try something different and authentically Peruvian, you'll have to try El Chullo.	lCd20nDS9rFHW_2KViqWUA	4	2016-10-01	0	0

0	d_TBs6J3twMy9GChqUEXkg	syvgxGvlJV4fqm7_3xKXuA	I had the pleasure to go to El Chullo this morning for 'breakfast' (the quotes are because it was closer to lunch time and their breakfast foods are more like American lunch/dinner foods). This place is incredibly authentic. Our waiter (and possibly an owner?) is from a town just outside of Lima, so ya... pretty legit. The way their breakfast works is they have 3 choices that feed two people, each for 20$. The choices are chicharrones with a tamal, bread, and two coffees or a tenderloin sautee with bread and two coffees, or an egg dish with a tamal, bread and two coffees. We decided to get the tenderloin and add a tamal (cuz I wanted to try it). The tamal is large, delicious, and just like the ones I had when I was in Peru last summer... this is the real deal and very distinct from the typical Mexican tamale you may have elsewhere in Phoenix. The tamal has a little hard boiled egg (which obviously I ate and the husband didn't), some meat, some olives, and some hot peppers and served with an onion/citrus salad.... so good. I could just eat those tamals and be happy.  The tenderloin came in a sauce of sorts with onion and tomato and we ate it with the giant rolls given to us. The meat was soooo tender and flavorful. Their coffee was even good and we drank it black. The service is great. This place beats all of the other Peruvian restaurants that I have tried in town hands down and really took me back to when I was in Peru....like a little slice of vacation in my own neighborhood. I will certainly be back, I want to try dinner for sure and the chicharrones breakfast.... I think this place has serious 5 star potential, so we will see!	lCd20nDS9rFHW_2KViqWUA	4	2014-03-16	3	2

Glad I found it! My fiancé and I were pleasantly surprised with how good this small place is.  Every table was full on a Saturday night.  We weren't used to seeing this in Phoenix.  The arroz con pollo was so good! We also ordered ceviche which was bomb.   The texture of the fish was perfect.  I also tried a pisco sour which was excellent.	lCd20nDS9rFHW_2KViqWUA	5	2017-04-27	0	0

As far as that last review by a lady named Leslie, I think she was way too hard on them. Some of the very very very best restaurants are just small little places, and family owned.! Sometimes you have to have patience when places like that are busy. They always always are welcoming, so she must of had an attitude problem. And that's probably hitting the nail on the head! I love this place and so do many of my friends. Don't let it get you down, El. chullo! We still luv you!  It's the best Peruvian food in the whole valley! And I've been to the other ones. I could tell you way way way worse stories.	lCd20nDS9rFHW_2KViqWUA	5	2017-06-05	0	0

The ceviche is outstanding and we'll be ordering that every time.  Everything we ordered was delicious and even my 1 year old enjoyed the food and she's a picky eater.  Our waitress was Maria and she was great and gave great recommendations.  We're definitely coming back.	lCd20nDS9rFHW_2KViqWUA	5	2014-01-31	0	0

I feel like I should always try these tiny places with """"foreign"""" food but I never really do because I'm afraid most would be misses rather than hits. This was a hit and has inspired to try more places like this! Our friends had heard good things about this place so we gave it a shot and I will keep going back!We ordered a few apps to share: Anticucho, Papa Rellena, and Yuca Frita. We loved them all! The Anticucho and Yuca Fritas were so good I will definitely order them every time I go!Then each of us order an entree. I got the Arroz con Mariscos, Jess got the Arroz con Pollo, my fiance the Ceviche and Josh the Lomo Saltado. To be honest I was pretty disappointed with my dish because it was more like a plate of rice with 4 pieces of seafood. However, Jess' Pollo tasted amazing, it had great seasoning. Mike's cveiche and Josh's Lomo were great too. We all left stuffed and happy!We will definitely be going back. Love the vibe of a family restaurant. We also recommend the Pisco Sours!It is a tiny place so if it's full you may have to wait. It'll be worth it!"""	lCd20nDS9rFHW_2KViqWUA	4	2014-05-11	0	0
1	fr0Nen1J499HvNml3_6OYA	pVyY6tPJbcMgPcAjN-PD3g	First tip-Parking lot in the back through an alley. Easier than the front. My friend and I came here to check it out and overall, we loved it. We came on a Saturday for lunch and it wasn't crowded so we got one on one personal treatment with the chef so we learned a lot. Not to sound like a broken record but the ceviche is soooo good. I love the flavors. The ceviche is just the fish marinated and the ceviche mixto is fish, squid, mussels, and clams.  I think the ceviche of just fish is the better of the two. It just holds the flavor better.  And when they ask you how spicy, they actually mean it. The medium is pretty decently spicy.  So impressive since it's hard to actually get something to be spicy here in Phoenix.  I can only imagine how spicy hot is.  Been here three times and I still crave it. Ok, on to other things I've tried several things and so far only one thing wasn't all that great but everything else has been.The causa rellena with imitation crab would be the one thing i say to avoid. My friend and I didnt think it was all that great esp. The arroz con pollo was yummy. The carapulcra is a pork stew and is like a comfort food. If you like spicy, make sure to ask for the aji rocoto - Peruvian hot sauce/salsa. So yummy. It adds a good spice to the mild dishes. Good lomo saltado according to bf. I do like that the fries are crispy and skinny. The kicker is that if you go now, they finally have air conditioning!!!  It was getting to be a bit difficult going during the summer so I can only imagine how the workers felt. Warning though, if you are from California and used to Peruvian food there, they don't carry the green aji sauce that we know and love.  Apparently that's only a CA creation since we're so used to jalapeños.This is a must place. From the wait staff to the food, everything is too notch.	lCd20nDS9rFHW_2KViqWUA	5	2014-08-23	4	1

0	WzY-ix_XunGOWhuLoE4F2Q	3JbNh7sRW4R7sIcv9Irjdw	Well I was just visiting Phoenix and needed a lunch spot fast. Stumbled across this place and could not have been happier with the food and service. This is not fine dining, it is a neighborhood place with as close to homemade latin food as you can get. I started with some yucca frittas which were great and came with two very tasty salsas. I had a chicken dish (forgot the name) with a red sauce that was slightly greasy but packed with flavor and delicious. My friend had the arroz con pollo which was also excellent. Crap even the iced tea was apparently homemade. The server was attentive and made us feel at home. The place doesn't look like much but it is a great place for well prepared Peruvian food at good prices. I will definitely go here again when I'm in town.	lCd20nDS9rFHW_2KViqWUA	4	2016-03-10	0	0

Don't let the interior (or exterior) discourage you.  Having absolutely no experience with Peruvian cuisine I had not idea what the carapulcra would be.  It was definitely a different take on 'stew', but it was delicious and they even stack your rice into the shapes of temples.4/5 service2/5 decor5/5 food5/5 location(pictures coming)	lCd20nDS9rFHW_2KViqWUA	5	2017-03-02	0	0

Truly a hole-in-the-wall from the outside but a nice cozy restaurant in the inside. The wait staff were friendly and efficient. I had the Yuca Fritas appetizer and Mariscos con Arroz entreé. I enjoy the Yuca and the two sauces. Some of the Yuca pieces were hard and stringy, but the rest was quite nice. The Mariscos were a disappointment. A few pieces of the seafood were very hard and chewy like they were seriously overlooked. These pieces were inedible. Most of the rest of the dish was good, but not great. I was expecting more flavor that would make this uniquely Peruvian. I will come back again and order a completely different entreé. I want to like this place and I think it's definitely worth another shot.	lCd20nDS9rFHW_2KViqWUA	3	2015-09-10	0	0

0	pwQ8E-hbDUJe3qtKt_IBBg	DW0-m8jns_rU2KHur_aP1w	I am a big supporter of family owned business so I decided to stop by and see what all the fuss is about. I have never had peruvian food before so I can't really compare my experience to another peruvian restaurant. The lot is small and it's kind of hard to park.  The service is good.  The server was really friendly and he tried to give us recommendations.  I ordered the Lomo Saltado and it was flavorful, but I didn't see the difference between that and the nacho fries that you get at Filibertos for half the price. Now, don't get me wrong.  It was a cool experience, but when we got the bill, it was a little much for an appetizer sampler, a drink, one entree, and dessert. I didn't even end up with a doggie bag for the price we paid. I didn't expect to pay as much as what we had paid, but I know they have to pay their bills.  It's a  business.  I get it. I just don't know if I would justify the price and value of the food to come back.  If you have never had peruvian food, come on over though and try it. At least once.	lCd20nDS9rFHW_2KViqWUA	3	2014-04-08	1	0

0	WMMI5Q4Rmm1Rqdu0jOvyhQ	fmlVqecTTk4CPR98yXAPbg	Its a good sign when you feel explosively full after a meal and yet still wear a silly grin on your face.  Such was the case during my first visit to El Chullo. Admittedly I'm a novice when it comes to Peruvian cuisine so it was with some apprehension that I ventured here on a Saturday around Noon.  I had seen the great reviews this place was getting, but honestly had no idea what to order when I got there.  Fortunately my waitress helped guide me through it, and helped me make some delicious choices indeed.As with so many Mom & Pop ethnic establishments in the Downtown Phoenix vicinity, the restaurant is a small space in an old building.  This space is on the northeast corner of 7th Street & Virginia, in between a barber shop and a convenience store.  There's barely any parking up front (though there were available spots when I arrived).  There is, fortunately, extra parking available in back (take the alleyway east of the convenience store and you'll run into a parking lot leading into El Chullo's back entrance).  The restaurant itself seats about 20-25 including the bar area.  When you walk in you immediately hear the Peruvian dance music in the background.  When I arrived just before Noon I was actually the only customer there, though the lunch crowd started streaming in shortly thereafter.  A quick FYI that from 10am-Noon on the weekends, they serve breakfast only.  It was close enough to Noon that they allowed me to go with the lunch menu instead, but just be aware of this if you're coming here on the weekend.  I started things off by ordering a traditional Pisco Sour.  Pisco is basically a type of Peruvian Brandy and a Sour is traditionally mixed with lime, syrup, bitters, and egg whites.  Wow, talk about refreshing.  There's enough alcohol to remind you its a cocktail, but truly a smooth, delicious, easy drinking cocktail perfect for any occasion.  For an appetizer I went with the Causa Rellena with crab filling (you can also choose a chicken filling).  Two potato cakes with crab filling and avocado in the middle, topped with a dusting of cilantro, half a hard boiled egg, and what I believe was a liquified sweet potato sauce.  Holy moly was this awesome.  It wasn't huge (maybe 3 inches in diameter & 3 inches tall), but remarkably rich and filling.  I'm not sure what type of potato they used for the potato cakes, but the texture was smoother than any potato I've had (maybe they used extra butter?).  And there was plenty of crab meat in there to be sure.  If you're coming here for the first time, get this.  I'm making it mandatory.After the appetizer, I had no idea what I was doing, so I let the waitress pick the next two items for me.  For the main entree, she recommended trying one of the ceviches since this was my first time here.  I went with the Ceviche Mixto since that had a variety of seafood (though admittedly I didn't ask which kinds).  The seafood is garnished with onions and a spicy lime juice blend (you can get it super spicy, or go with a mild spice level as I did) and comes with sides of sweet potatoes, sweet corn, and cancha (basically dried corn).  Again, didn't look like a huge portion but they packed in a ton of seafood into this dish. In addition to the fish (which I believe was sea bass) there was lots of shrimp, clams, mussels, calamari, and octopus.  I'm not a huge fan of squid or octopus so I was a little apprehensive when I saw it, but actually this style tasted quite delicious.  All of the seafood tasted fresh and the lime sauce had the perfect amount of seasoning.  There's actually enough food in this dish to be split by two people, which probably explains why I felt pretty full after I finished.  Nevertheless, the waitress prodded me to try one of their desserts, so she had me try the Alfajor.  Two round flaky sugar cookies covered in powdered sugar with dulce de leche filling in the middle and chocolate sauce on the side.  I don't how in the world I had room for this, but I made it happen.  The dulce de leche was buttery smooth and the cookie cut with a fork.  An awesome, decadent conclusion. Absolutely incredible meal.  The presentation, the flavors, and the variety was amazing.  They actually have a number of chicken and beef dishes to choose from as well, and I'll be sure to try those upon my next visit.  Total cost for this go around including the drink, appetizer, entree, dessert, tax and tip came to $50.  Worth every penny as El Chullo's cuisine could easily work as a fine dining experience (though I'm thrilled its just a neighborhood joint that I can wear my flip flops to).  I now see why Peruvian cuisine is quickly conquering American pallets, and El Chullo is Phoenix's ground zero.	lCd20nDS9rFHW_2KViqWUA	5	2015-04-25	3	0
1	icMCEESVs2TU_NkIZM142w	VxeUVhFCSXUAEL-1PUKR5A	"""We decided to live up to our hype of being open-minded and try something unique to Phoenix (i.e., not Mexican; not Vietnamese; not Chinese; etc.).  And that's how we ended up at El Chullo; though, to be fair, we almost DIDN'T end up at El Chullo's.  A previous reviewers comment about parking being limited is like saying Marlon Brando was slightly overweight towards the end.  Let's just say, the parking lot is shared with other businesses; the """"lot"""" is about one car wide; and one has to do fancy gyrations to park and withdraw one's car IF one can get a spot.  After driving around three times, we parked in the printing shop's lot across the street (which, I'm sure, will thrill them to no end when/if they read this).  Go during the standard 9 to 5 business hours and you may find yourself outta luck or risking a tow.Alas, the parking spots are not the only thing small about El Chullo.  In fact, """"small"""" pretty much describes it all:  the parking. the restaurant, the portions.  I was rather amused (bemused) by the comment from one of the reviewers that the portions are """"very large"""".  Really?  VERY large?  Perhaps for someone who survived  internment at Sherrif Joe's Tent City or who usually dines on those diet programs' pre-packaged food (served in upscale concentration camps).  Granted, this is not to say that the portions were pretentiously small like a la carte francais food; they were perfectly acceptably sized for people, who eat like they're supposed to  (translation:  non-Americans).  We, however, are of the MOO crowd, so for us, all of dinner was something akin to """"snack"""".  (Hey, I workout, get off my case!).We started out with the appetizer platter for $14.95 and chose the Chicken Causa Rell; the Papa Rellena; and the Papa ala Huancaina.  Presented very artistically, I would not say it was an appetizer for two AMERICANS.  Taste was quite good and unique, though the standout taste was potato (hardly a surprise since """"papa"""" means 'potato').I had a very spicy cerviche mixto and my other half, the escabeche de pollo.  Both very good -- the latter served with rice and a small portion of cold, sweet potato -- but we weren't exactly unbuckling our belts at meal's end.  Again, like I said:  not small, but not big by the usual, middle-class American standards, where the men are men, eat like men, and doctors buy brand new cars every month with all the money they get from bypass and pacemaker surgeries.  Nuff said.The diet Inka Cola, colored like Mountain Dew but tasting like cream soda, is good, but $2.00 a can?  For both of us, the bill came to $46.41 without tip.  Not tragic, but a bit overboard for the quantity.  Maybe reasonable considering the uniqueness of the food.  The 20% tip for Omar, however, was well in line.  Attentive service without being overbearing and very accommodating.  That's one thing I really can't make any complaints about (and as you see, I have no issue complaining).While I agree with the other, previous 17 reviewers that this is a very nice restaurant, I am not wowed enough to give it 5 Stars.  Those who read my reviews know I'm not generous with my highest rating and you've got to earn it.  For those looking for something different, tasty and served with good attitude, this restaurant is just fine.  If you're a big eater, don't expect to come here and not want something more afterwards.  No one there looked unhappy and we weren't either ... just not full."""	lCd20nDS9rFHW_2KViqWUA	3	2014-03-22	1	0

I had not seen this preparation before and as a Peruvian and a foodie I have an abundant amount of experience in Peruvian cuisine! The flavor was incredible, bursting with flavor! A bit of Rocoto to add a nice touch of spiciness. I had to order a side a rice so I could absorb all of the fabulous juice. My wife had a sampler platter with Papa a la Huancaina, papa rellena and causa! She raved about each of them. She also had an Afajor for dessert and it was wonderful! The owners are a family, each contributing to the success of the restaurant! Pricing is competitive. We went this evening  and had to wait about 15 minutes as we apparently are not the only ones who know about this wonderful little restaurant! The restaurant is small but as they continue to build a clientele, this place is certain to grow and be even more successful!	lCd20nDS9rFHW_2KViqWUA	5	2016-07-31	0	0

I've been several times, and the food is always delicious. My favorite is the Tacu Tacu with lomo. I get it every time, but I know I should try other things too! The ceviche and lomo soltado are also very good. The ceviche is fresh, and the lomo just doesn't disappoint - full of flavor! This time around, I fortunately had a friend who was wanting to split two dishes! I forget the one she got (it's in the pictures), but it was a beef stew. The beef was very tender, but we both agreed the Tacu Tacu was better of the two. The Tacu Tacu has a great consistency and texture. It's crispy on the outside and firm, not mushy, on the inside. The lomo that comes with it is in a sauce with onions and tomatoes - very flavorful! The ooooooonly thing that I'll say bad about this place that it may be a tad too salty sometimes.

The adults had a carafe of white sangria and the kids had a Peruvian staple, chicha.We had the appetizer platter, and chose fried yuca, causa rellena, and a Peruvian tamal. We ate every last ounce of food and sauce!For our entrees, the kids had the tallarin and salchipapas, and the adults had ceviche and the mixed seafood platter. The ceviche was some of the best Peruvian ceviche we've had. The seafood platter was made up of deep fried fish, shrimp, calamari, and oysters. It was served with boiled potatoes and fried yuca.Everything was great, and the service was awesome. The seafood platter was a little over cooked, but then again it's deep fried so what can you expect. We will definitely come back and bring our Peruvian neighbors to enjoy tasty authentic food they don't have to prepare themselves. :-)	lCd20nDS9rFHW_2KViqWUA	4	2016-01-10	3	1

I was the only one in my party that had eaten Peruvian food before and everyone else had a lot of questions. The waitress was so nice and patient. She obviously took a lot of pride in the food they serve, particularly their more traditional food and drinks.This place is a must try.	lCd20nDS9rFHW_2KViqWUA	5	2015-01-26	1	0

Can't remember the names of what I ordered but the appetizer was a thin sliced marinated fried potato. You eat them like potato chips but they are not dry and slightly crispy. The entrée was a chicken breast, pan fried in a red pepper vinegar sauce with red onion slices. Very good! There was a small side of potatoes and a rather large pyramid of white rice. I love rice but I prefer it flavored. I almost asked for more red pepper vinegar sauce for the rice. It was similar to Japanese sticky rice. The place was small, clean, nice artwork on the walls, flat screen tv with Fox Spanish channel showing a soccer game. They have a full bar so we ordered a carafe of Sangria- iced, filled with what appeared to be fruit cocktail- very good and pared well with the meal. We ate the wine soaked fruit like a dessert. El Chullo has an air of authenticity about it and I most likely will go back in the future.	lCd20nDS9rFHW_2KViqWUA	4	2015-05-22	1	0
0	2YpteZK4bSjA-WThsGDrtQ	WL013hLASfHo8fecum_rNQ	Delicious! My husband, who is Peruvian, felt this was authentic. Only downside would've been that they were understaffed. It's not a big place, but once it filled up, the one waitress was running. Also, parking is limited, which is typical for DT Phoenix. Highly recommend trying at least once. Our favorites were: Lomo saltado (beef with French fries and gravy-like sauce), papa rellena (stuffed potato), tallarin saltado con carne (tenderloin with spaghetti) and of course pisco sours!	lCd20nDS9rFHW_2KViqWUA	5	2017-05-10	0	0

Neither my mom nor I had ever tried Peruvian food so we thought we would give this place a try. It's right on 7th street so parking in front of the small restaurant (7 tables and a few chairs at a small bar) is very limited, so if you miss it, just turn right on the first street and then take a right into the alley and park in the small lot behind the restaurant. You can also enter through doors on the back or walk around to the front.  We shared an appetizer and each got a meal and drink waters and our total bill was approximately $36.  We loved everything. I can't remember the names for each, but I'll post pics!	lCd20nDS9rFHW_2KViqWUA	4	2016-07-16	1	0

I've had this place bookmarked for ages and never seem to be in this area around eating time.This is a really cool family owned and operated restaurant. The inside is very cozy and decorated with interesting Peruvian style artwork as well as several articles and """"Best of"""" awards displayed proudly on the walls.We came for the lunch service which starts at noon. The menu is loaded with a good variety of Peruvian favorites. It was tough to choose what we wanted and took advantage of the photos on Yelp to decide. The server was also most helpful and gave us a good idea on how it would taste.We started with an appetizer plate that had a mixture of three different items. See my photo. The Papa Rellena was our favorite in the grouping. It is described as a golden-fried creamy potato dough stuffed with meat, eggs, raisins and olives and served with red onions marinated in lime juice. So good!The ladies ordered a dish with Rice & Peruvian beans topped with a cilantro Beef stew called Frijoles con seco a la norteña. Yours truly ordered one called Escabeche de Pollo with a side of their spicy homemade Hot Sauce. It is pan fried Chicken garnished with sautéed red onion, aji amarillo, aji panca, & vinegar.Both the food and service were spectacular. The wonderful and unique flavors of all the dishes are hard to describe and definitely something you will have to try. The service was very friendly and helpful. We even had the chance to talk to the chef and get a couple of top secret tips that she uses in her recipes.This is not a very big place and the parking area is really small out front. They say there is also additional parking behind the restaurant with a back entrance when very busy.Can't wait to eat here again and maybe even try recreating a couple recipes at home. This stuff is plate licking crazy good. Just try and restrain yourself and use a spoon. Simplemente Delicioso!4.75 STARS"""	lCd20nDS9rFHW_2KViqWUA	5	2015-12-20	46	36

2	Hy_ko_2hkLTxvO7G0pIGsw	LpKiGHvYCr6l5_VKzFBWxA	I love this place, my favorite cuisine first of all is peruvian, and I am so happy to say that El Chullo has become my favorite peruvian restaurant (thus far in my culinary journey). The ceviche here is perfectly spiced, the texture of the fish is great, and the sweet potatoes and the canchas (salted corn nuts) offset the spiciness, wow just typing this review makes my mouth water. I literally cannot wait to go back for more! The entree size of the ceviche isn't enough if you are starved, but its a perfect portion for someone who isn't too hungry. My boyfriend and I ordered one ceviche each and then we also ordered a lomo saltado to share. The lomo El Chulo serves is great, delicious thin fries, with nicely seasoned juicy pieces of steak topped off with onions, red onions and tomatoes. Order this if you are a steak and potatoes type of person. For dessert we shared an alfajor, 2 fine light cookies with dulce de leche stuffed between the two, finished off with a slight dusting of powdered sugar and chocolate on the side. To be perfectly honest I was so full already from eating a ceviche and sharing a lomo saltado that I felt that I didn't have any room for dessert, but when the cookie came I HAD to have a taste, so I ate a bite and we ended up packing that bad boy up to go. All in all this place was great, people might think its expensive, but its 100% worth it to me. The flavours I get from peruvian cuisine is so unique and unmatched that I am more than happy to pay for it. Oh and did I mention our server Manny, *unsure if this is the right spelling* but man he was the best!!! He made us feel right at home, and even told us a little bit of himself and Peru as we were eating our dinner.  All in all it was a great time and a great meal! I can't wait to go back.. perhaps I'll stop in for lunch and or dinner tonight because honestly I just can't get enough.	lCd20nDS9rFHW_2KViqWUA	5	2014-05-29	4	2

While bringing our pisco to the table, one of the waiters questioned the validity of my friend's Arizona driver's license (she is 26 years old). She said condescendingly """"Hmm I don't know if this is real because I don't want minors drinking here, but I'll give the drink to you this time"""". She then proceeded to comment on how young I appear as well, even though I didn't order a drink (surprise, I'm also 26!). On top of that, the bottom of my friend's drink literally fell out of the glass while she was drinking. Her food, shirt, and belongings were covered in pisco sour. Instead of uttering a single word of apology, the same waiter commented on how """"this happens all the time"""". Incredulous, I asked her if the bottoms of glasses commonly fall out in this restaurant. She responded """"oh no, I just assumed that she dropped it, the glass falling out has never happened before"""". Needless to say, the food is good, but the waiter's patronizing behavior was unwelcome and reflects poorly on the potential of this restaurant. Will not be returning because of that reason.

Thee stars only as I thought the staff was not the friendliest and the Sangria was mostly fruit juice and very little wine. The parking lot in front of restaurant is very small with very few spots so be ready to park in the neighborhood. Ordered the Lomo Saltado, which essentially is slivers of beef with French fries. and while I thought was good, could have had more meat considering the price of $ 14.95 . El Chullo is not an inexpensive restaurant. A word of caution, the restaurant closes early on Sundays at 7 P.M so get there early.	lCd20nDS9rFHW_2KViqWUA	3	2015-08-28	1	1

The anticuchos are just right and ideally spiced, the ocopa was perfect, the papa rellena was delicious.The spices and general flavor is authentic, rich and tasty.There is a good variety of dishes, some of which you can't find elsewhere in Arizona.Presentation is good, sides are well chosen. Portions are bigger than average for the entrees.Lucuma ice cream tasted just like in Peru.Not so good:-Dishes are somewhat overpriced.  -The arroz con mariscos could use more seafood, more limon and more aji. It was too greasy and not spicy enough.-Although the food was clean, and so were the napkins and silverware, there were a few bugs crawling on the floor. It's understandable. The weather is heating up. I just never saw that many in a restaurant. Some pest control would be a good idea.Overall, I recommend this place for authentic Peruvian food and family ambience.

0	vWtX3HVddxxAjFw_jZHZBA	Ec3nV4KsW9WCplfaUxYTjQ	My new favorite Peruvian restaurant. I had the tallarines verdes with the bistek on the side (for my carnivorous husband) because I don't eat meat and they were more than accommodating and did not seem to judge me for doing that (which most places do). The tallarines verdes is the best I've had in Arizona and I will only go to El Chullo to have it. You know how you grab on to your bed sheets because the feeling is so glorious and out of this world? Yes, it's like that! I can't wait to try the other entrees, specifically, the vegetarian options. The alfajores is also delicious; flaky but held it's form and not overwhelmingly sweet - it definitely quieted my sweet tooth. The chicha morada is also quenching - not bitter and too sweet, just right - be sure to order the pitcher because you will drink it like water.It's a quaint place to eat. They have lunch specials/combo. The parking situation is a little challenging, but I would like to go there at least once a week to satisfy my Peruvian food cravings. I hope you check out this place because although it's easy to miss (because of location), you'll be sorry if you don't go.	lCd20nDS9rFHW_2KViqWUA	5	2014-01-10	1	1

Who I believe was one of the owners/main chef greeted us and explained it might be a while before we could order because they were so busy. She was so warm and kind and so was everyone else. My friend and I had a pisco maracuya (passion fruit pisco) and they were delicious. We also split a causa rellena, a cold mashed potato cake with a chicken filling, and the lomo saltado, a dish with beef tenderloin and french fries and rice.  Everything was really delicious and seasoned so well but next time I will probably opt for less starch in one meal.  I rated this five stars because I really couldn't get over how wonderful the overall experience was to talk with the Peruvian chef and feel somewhat like I was with family :). Also, this woman recommended the ceviche because it's prepared unique to Peruvian culture and I will say it looked amazing at someone else's table.	lCd20nDS9rFHW_2KViqWUA	5	2015-05-31	0	0

I had the Tacu Tacu Con Lomo Saltado, which is rice and beans topped with strips of marinated sirloin steak.  The rice must be cooked in a small cast iron skillet and flipped over, because it has a seriously delicious exterior with a slight crunch.  The beans and lomo saltado are equally excellent.  Portion sizes are large, and they have a small selection of wine.  Really delicious and highly recommend.  Parking: After business hours (ie: 6:00pm) you can park either across 7th street at the auto shop, or across Virginia street, just south of El Chullo, in the parking lot behind the 3 story building (Techniprint).	lCd20nDS9rFHW_2KViqWUA	5	2014-08-04	5	0

1	V-BbqKqO8anwplGRx9Q5aQ	E03TXTw9lzBz01XLqiBYcg	This is a very small Peruvian Restaurant with a bar. They serve mostly Peruvian Food thats heavy with rice and lots of potatoes. They start everyone of with tasty complimentary corn nuts. We started with the Peruvian Specialty Appetizer called papas a la huancaina that means basically a boiled potato topped with a creamy chile cheese sauce. I thought it tasted good but for me this dish is an acquired taste kind of dish because of the texture. I ordered the Arroz Chaufa (a chicken fried rice) because it sounded like the lightest dish on the menu. The chicken in my dish was developed with flavor and was very moist. I thought this dish was tasty but it was an extremely large portion so I took half home.My husband had the Frijol con Seco a la Nortena (basically a beef stew with rice and beans). I tried a little piece of beef that also was prepared well and was flavorful and moist. The pickled onions were bright and bursting with lime flavor. This was also a large portion.The pictures of the desserts looked interesting and mostly different from other desserts I've seen and our server talked me into getting his favorite dessert the crema volteada. It was like a very dense flan with a dark sugar coating. It seemed rich and wasn't too sweet.Service was very friendly and welcoming.	lCd20nDS9rFHW_2KViqWUA	4	2015-05-24	2	2

My table had the Chupe de Camarones, which was a meal unto itself, 2 people had the the Aji de Gallina- which was very tasty and quite spicy and one had the Tallarines Verdes con Lomo.  We had traditional Pisco sours which were quite tasty as well.  The restaurant is very small but clean and the wait staff is vey pleasant.  The service is slow due to all plates being made to order but that is certainly one of the reasons the food is delicious.  I would definitely recommend this place if you are a fan of Peruvian food or curious to learn about it.  The prices are resonable as well. Our tab for 4 came to $153 and that was with 8 Pisco sours.  Like another reviewer said-""""Viva Peru carajo!"""""""	lCd20nDS9rFHW_2KViqWUA	4	2015-05-18	0	0

1	ZiE9NxtcVBBU2ahxNHhk7Q	-clrRIhce8mpz1pPc4MRzw	Incredible flavors and great service. As an individual who spent a lot of years in Peru I can appreciate what has been the best Peruvian food I've had in Phoenix - at El Chullo! Highly recommend the anticuchos, lomo saltado, and an alfajor for dessert. I look forward to my next dining experience here! (Probably tomorrow!)	lCd20nDS9rFHW_2KViqWUA	5	2014-01-10	3	2
0	DUrVKLyuO8Ng-XM9voEPSg	y2kxqnUdkQU8FyJmh_xGuA	What! I don't know how I've been missing this place. The traditional Pisco sour was amazing, like an alcoholic, less sweet, key lime pie. I had chicharrones, a stuffed potato pastry that was cooked perfectly and full of flavor. Both were served with lime juice and cilantro marinated red onions that gave the dishes such perfect balance. A pork stew for my entree and I was stuffed to the gills and exceedingly pleased. The staff is crazy friendly. Will go back four to five million more times.	lCd20nDS9rFHW_2KViqWUA	5	2016-04-30	0	0

0	AaIlB4EmjfbmCtW7GoON_Q	2-H_HIfDflVs6yTwtL2Fhg	My husband got me hooked on this place. Their sushi is so expensive but it is so delicious and it's addictive. You get what you pay for and it's worth paying more for it.  Once you eat here no other sushi will do. Just saying.	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	5	2016-04-19	0	0
