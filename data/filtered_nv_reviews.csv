I had the chicken chimichanga and my friend had of the chicken burrito supreme. I will never visit Robertos, Pepe's tacos, etc. again. #obsessed	OQcvO5P3gH0cuJ-bPXwfQQ	5	2017-07-16	1	0

Walking inside I was greeted by a sweet young girl who also took my order and she was nice about going over the menu and what the specials included. Inside was clean and decorated nicer than I expected. There was also a good amount of customers eating inside which I took as a good sign. I noticed they had different daily specials on the windows out front and they are totally worth checking out. I was here on a Friday and the special that day is 2 enchiladas, beans, rice and a drink all for $5.95 before tax. Great deal! The rice was lacking a bit on flavor and while the beans could have used more cheese, they did taste good and I liked the few tortilla chips on top of them. The enchiladas had a decent amount of cheese inside and the sauce tasted good. I'd for sure come back for this special again.Al Pastor Taco ($1.75) - The tacos come meat, onion and cilantro. There's a salsa bar with veggies and containers. I grabbed some of the red and green sauce and favored the green. My taco was filled nicely and had great flavor. Carne Asada Burrito ($5.99) - Here's where things got odd for me. Hubby and I intended to share this and he always prefers just meat, cheese and sour cream in his burritos. The girl who took our order said he couldn't have it that way and that the burrito had to have beans and rice inside. If the burritos aren't pre-made this shouldn't be a hard request at all. I saw a different girl putting meat on the grill and then put the burrito together, so I can't figure out why the burrito couldn't be customized to have the rice and beans left off. The burrito was a nice size for the price and did taste good, but it would have been better enjoyable if it could have been made the way preferred. Great weekly deals and decent Mexican food. I'd come back.	OQcvO5P3gH0cuJ-bPXwfQQ	4	2017-06-20	66	67

I've been to this restaurant probably 10 to 15 times and have never had a bad meal. Is the owner and staff of this restaurant are very nice and courteous and provide a good service and excellent food. I highly recommend this place for anything Mexican on their menu you will not be disappointed.	OQcvO5P3gH0cuJ-bPXwfQQ	5	2016-06-12	1	1

Reminded me a little of Texas, in terms of quality. Enchilada was very tasty, great sauce. Rice and beans were both delicious. Chile Relleno needed a tiny bit more flavor, but had plenty of cheese. Great little salsa bar. Had a bite of gf's Huevos Rancheros and we agreed that they were pretty awesome. We'll be back soon.	OQcvO5P3gH0cuJ-bPXwfQQ	4	2015-08-01	4	2

I haven't got my food yet, but the smell coming out the kitchen is amazing. It's a Friday night in Vegas, at a hole in the wall taco shop. The single file line is out the door.....Now that's a recipe for GREAT Mexican food	OQcvO5P3gH0cuJ-bPXwfQQ	5	2017-03-11	0	0

Just might have to give up my usual taco spot!!!! Food was great. My only critic no chips and salsa before the meal and only gives you a couple chips stuck in the great beans!!! Also might look into making up paper menus. Nothing to take home to read. The service impeccable. Will be back for sure.	OQcvO5P3gH0cuJ-bPXwfQQ	5	2015-07-22	1	0

I was craving authentic tacos, as i reminisced on my favorite taco shop in san francisco.      First stop was Cardenas. It was closer to me but the lines were ridiculous and the environment chaotic. Needless to say, i left in search of greener pastures. Second stop, the las vegas chain Rigos tacos. The place gave me a creepy vibe plus their soda machine was not working. I'm all for hole in the wall places but this place was too much.     As I drove aimlessly i came across this place, Mi pueblo Taco shop. Boy was I pleasantly surprised!! my  long search of a mom & pop taco shop proved fruitful. The lady at the counter and the cook turned out to be husband and wife, and the owners. They were both extremely friendly  and the food was delicious!! they had weird pricing quirks but hopefully they figure it out. overall, 5 stars and will definitely come back again.

1	cQzo2WX1TyPEmS5jPzOUoA	sG2U7rH5NSTYR3-DumVT7w	TLDR: Lunch Specials; salsa bar available; excellent service; subpar food; convenience charge for card paymentI was really craving excellent chips and salsa so I usually have a go-to spot for Mexican fare. Learning that they were closed, I found something in the area with excellent reviews and was happy to find this location with a Yelp check-in.  I skimmed the reviews and saw several 4/5 star reviews with a couple of 2 star reviews so I decided to give this place a shot. Service was excellent and I was impressed with the politeness and grammar used in both English and Spanish upon walking in and ordering. It reflected that the business cares about the customer and how they are perceived when spoken to by the various clientele. I immediately placed an order for the chips and beans and was happy to see breakfast items on a menu. My foodie friend ordered a pastor burrito and I ordered chilaquiles with green sauce. Unfortunately, this is where I should've listened to the 2-star reviews. While I believe that the food is made fresh in-house, the quality lacks and pales in comparison to the service. The beans lacked flavor, excluding the cotija cheese and the chips were stale. This is probably a storage issue. The salsa were flavorful, but lacked spice. Interestingly enough, the green salsa was the spiciest. My friends pastor burrito was just ok. Not fantastic, not terrible. Just ok. It probably is similar to Roberto's, my terrible baseline for Mexican food flavor and service. My chilaquiles were tragic. The rice was pretty bad and the green sauce was pretty boring. It's sad to say that Del Taco has better rice, beans, and green sauce. Needless to say, I didn't enjoy the dish and I won't return anytime soon.	OQcvO5P3gH0cuJ-bPXwfQQ	2	2017-07-15	2	0

0	d9y5MjVOgxcP4Zc7qjowdA	PM5aFLiwbKWDm_AtC71-3Q	I walked in my scrubs and the owner asked me how I found out about his place.  I told him Yelp and that I was in the area for a school assignment and lived across town.  He never heard of Yelp and didnt know that his place has a 5 star rating.  He was wearing an SD cap and I found out he lived in San Diego.  If you ever had authentic San Diego Mexican food you know this place is legit, because it reminded me of that.  I found this to be a unique experience with genuinely nice restaurant owners not catering to Yelp reviewers.  Hopefully that won't change after my random stop there.I had a carnitas burrito, cachete taco and carne asada taco, and a horchata (no not Smart Chata).  Overall the carne asada was the most flavorful with a nice charred taste.  The cachete was tasty.  My carnitas burrito was good too, similar to the SD burritos I miss.  Tortilla, meat, rice, beans, and since I'm originally from San Francisco I added some sour cream with guacamole.  The salsa was also fresh and tasty.	OQcvO5P3gH0cuJ-bPXwfQQ	5	2016-11-03	3	3

Everything I had was simply delicious and would go out of my way to venture in this neighborhood for Tacos and Mexican foodThe cashier/server was very friendly and asked if it was my first time here. She answered my questions and made me feel welcomed. I originally was going to order Tacos only but the enchilada combo grab my attention and got the combo with a single order of Carne Asada Taco on the side because I had to get a taco too. When the order finally arrived at my table. I got the three different salsas that was available at the salsa bar. From the first bite of my taco and enchiladas 1-beef & 2-chicken combination along with the fresh salsas. Every bite was amazingly flavorful and authentic. The whole experience was great and felt like I was taking a short vacation in Mexico!	OQcvO5P3gH0cuJ-bPXwfQQ	5	2016-07-05	4	2

I have had every single meal available here, and I NEVER once had anything that was bland or stale. They Cook everything fresh, despite what others think. Even though I'm guessing those people have never seen the cooks in action. This place is 1 IN A MILLION! I've been going since they've opened in 2008. I have never regretted going there. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PLACE AND THE OWNERS! It's such a shame when people check in on here to get free food and THEN POST NEGATIVE REVIEWS ABOUT THE FOOD THAT THEY ACTUALLY HAVE TO PAY FOR LOL.

The complimentary chips and beans I got for my Yelp check-in were excellent. I upgraded to a larger size beans in order to share. You can tell these beans are the real thing.... slow cooked with love for the flavor and not smashed too much. Yum.My husband has the carne asada burrito, it was huge, their version came with rice and beans inside the burrito, a little different than other taco shops I have been to.I had the combination plate, Chicken Enchilada, Chiles Relleno, and Chicken Taco. This plate came with rice and beans. Everything was excellent, but the star of the show was the taco!My next visit I will definitely try some of the other tacos on the menu. The salsas in the salsa bar were amazing, I put it on everything!So here is the bad news about this place........ the neighborhood! This shopping center and parking lot is scary! There are so many people loitering in front of the next door liquor store. I am glad I was with my husband, I really would not have felt safe coming here without him and coming here after dark.......

The burrito was tasty and plentiful, """"sandwich"""" with the fried pork, Pastor tortas, absolutely satisfying, simple and perfect. The hot salsas were fun and tasty. Enjoy"""	OQcvO5P3gH0cuJ-bPXwfQQ	5	2016-12-29	0	0

Stepping into this place, it's an enigma wrapped in an enigma. Sholay isn't heavily advertised in your face so you don't know what to expect. The restaurant name brings memories of the legendary movie and elite characters. Come on. Don't tell me you can't hear Amjad Khan's voice :) Enough of me being Basanti . The place has: a large poster of Shah Rukh Khan, a pic of the Dalai Lama , and generic scenery pics. As you walk in you are promptly greeted by two American white people. The instinct as a desi is to run away but please resist this urge. You find out the staff, are owners and chefs who love desi food. The """"white dude"""" who is their head chef, couldn't be more """"desi"""" when it comes to spices and food. Loved the chicken wings and chicken kabob here. Only con: they are only open till 7pm."""	bzUSbd9YLoK3egnTkXFd1Q	5	2014-07-12	0	0

There are three or four Indian curries on the menu. We got the chicken curry. The guy (there was only one person there, to cook and work the counter, but they weren't busy, so hey) said it was really good. If you're desi, you know what shan and all the boxed masalas taste like, and this definitely had that taste. Not saying it's a bad thing, but fresh masalas give a curry an aroma that this lacked. The chicken shish kabob was bland, except for the red chili powder added liberally on top, and it wasn't actual shish kabob. The best thing I had was the lamb burger. Oh my gosh. The lamb was super juicy. And the fries already had black pepper. Loved it. The place is super duper clean. Even the bathroom. Like I said, there was one person to cook, serve, answer calls, and take orders. He told us the others were out for a catering. This is in no way true Indian food. The shish kabobs aren't Indian shish kabobs, but rather Middle Eastern kabobs, the naan isn't true naan, either. Don't go to this place expecting awesome Indian food. But it is a decent place to go for a burger or the pizza."""	bzUSbd9YLoK3egnTkXFd1Q	3	2014-05-06	1	0

My only complaint (almost 20 minutes for one to-go order with only 2 or 3 other customers at the time) was the waiting, but the employees were nice and made sure to let me know that I wasn't forgotten.  The shish kabobs were tender and savory, and their balsamic vinaigrette for my salad was the best I've ever had!!!  The saffron rice was also delicious even though it appeared to be the item that was delaying my order.   I should've called ahead, but next time, I want to try their lamb burgers...  Limited menu but top quality ingredients, yummm!3/12/14I returned there after work to pick up my lamb burger and side salad to go.  The ground lamb meat was indeed tasty, but I was disappointed by the smallish size compared to the bun.  I'll stick with the kabobs and rice in the future.  I was told by the nice man behind the counter that they'll be expanding the Indian portion of the menu in a few months so here's hoping they add samosas!	bzUSbd9YLoK3egnTkXFd1Q	4	2014-03-07	0	0
0	HRP5zLOrhXgLYAlaBt-HgA	dBWviP3LipdHhdwbpMjiTw	Their burgers are so juicy and flavorful. Also greatly priced, and did I mention the burgers! I only tried a beef burger but the chicken looked so good! Te service was great with friendly staff. Definitely must try again!	bzUSbd9YLoK3egnTkXFd1Q	5	2014-04-08	0	0
0	kmC8nIGdQeLUOBCgRDzS8g	e3IeKncWZa55LPadXaFyUw	Fresh food... exotic flavors.  Their tag line says it all!  I ordered the beef kabob on the recommendation of Phil, the owner, and I was not disappointed at all.  The halal meat was moist and spiced just right... absolutely delicious!  The basmati rice was also spiced in a subtle way that complemented the meat.  He brought me a sample of the rice pudding, and it was very good, along with the mango yogurt smoothie, which would be a refreshing drink come the hot days of summer.  I cannot wait to go back and try some of the other items that other Yelpers have raved about!	bzUSbd9YLoK3egnTkXFd1Q	5	2014-03-28	1	0
0	TyepNPbEnMCy1_IhsT0YAg	Q0Ngh3nFEiBnX4kng09ElQ	The friendliest worker ever works here. I think he is the owner, or just a very friendly man. Every time my boyfriend and I come here we get free stuff. Last time it was dessert, the other time it was mango lassi. The food is good and decent pricing. Sure, it's not the most glamorous presentations, but it is good for someone who is very hungry.This place just opened up like a 3 months ago, so they are pretty eager to get customers in.	bzUSbd9YLoK3egnTkXFd1Q	4	2014-05-11	0	0

I had heard about it through yelp but didn't expect to try it out anytime soon. I was taken back by the fact that the owner of the place was not Indian! He was VERY friendly though and so I give this place a 5 for customer service! After having asked if the meat was halal, the owner told us that everything was halal except for the beef pepperoni. I'm very grateful that he not only verbally stated it, but has it written down on the menu as well. We weren't really starving so we placed an order for halal wings & fries as well as the pizza naan (with chicken, cheese and pizza sauce). He asked us if we wanted him to make it spicy, and like most Indians and Pakistanis, OF COURSE we said yes. So he made added chillies as well. Fast forward to the food - the halal wings were GREAT. Spicy, but a little too breaded. My bf noticed this as well, and was the first one to point it out. The fries came out extremely salty, but I finished the majority of them anyways. The pizza naan was good! Especially if you like chicken keema! The chillies the owner added made it spicy and quite scrumptious. The best part of our trip to this place was definitely the MANGO LASSI. The owner gave us each a sample which led us to ordering one. The lassi was thick, unlike many other places you order a lassi, and you could taste the yogurt. YUM. The owner also gave us a sample of the rice pudding, but I wasn't that big of a fan. I'm not the biggest sugar addict but I just wasn't feeling it. I hope to come back for the lamb burger and the lassi next time! Overall, this isn't entirely """"Sholay"""". If you are looking for Indian (as in""""desi khana"""") food, go elsewhere. If you are looking for American styled Indian food, this is your place."""	bzUSbd9YLoK3egnTkXFd1Q	3	2014-04-02	1	0

I was immediately greeted and handed a menu, which has American breakfast specialties on the front, and inside is a small kabob selection, naan pizzas, and burgers. Very odd combination of offerings.Ordered the chicken kabob platter to go, and was offered a breaded chicken wing to sample while I waited- they are trying out new menu items. The wing was huge and mostly composed of breading, which is not what I'm looking for at all when I'm ordering wings. Flavor was okay, but the wing itself was just weird.Got home with my food in a reasonable amount of time and it was nice and hot- the kabobs were delicious, and my BF snagged a few bites even after devouring his sandwich. The rice in particular was very good: I'm not one to rave about rice, but it was moist and flavorful, and had some white, some yellow, and some orange in it- likely a combination of white and saffron rice, with additional seasonings. The naan and salad were also fresh, and the portion was generous, and on par with the $10 total. Best part of the meal was the cilantro sauce for the kabobs- it was killer. Highly recommend, get it on anything.	bzUSbd9YLoK3egnTkXFd1Q	2	2014-03-02	3	0
