It was worth the try but something I wouldn't eat again. We ordered number 7 with cheese for extra $3. The late night crowd is not a pleasant so I recommend anyone with little kids to go somewhere else.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	3	2017-05-30	0	0
1	RQqfT8WQlmFHmPp9X8G9jA	kloRfnnrU_DowHNSl1trhA	This place is over hyped and not worth filling up your stomach with, and emptying out your wallet for.  Be prepared to be greeted by two security guards as you enter the front door.  Expect two to four more security guards in the tiny, cramped dining establishment.  That is not intimidating at all.  The GF and I ordered a slider and fries.  I saw them putting pickles on the slider and knew this would be a no go for her.  Sadly, the cashier had already rung us up.  It took an awkward 2-3 minutes for him to refund and re-swipe my credit card.  Sure, it is my fault for making him go through all that trouble. But, could he not have simply told the person making the sliders to not add pickles?  A minute or two after being witness to sheer incompetence, our number is called.  I guess in all the confusion, they forgot to put fries in the bag (even though I was charged for it).  Despite being the only one in line to order, I feel this place can be described as chaotic.  There were so many employees at work.  There must have been hundreds of sliders already pre-cooked and just hanging out, waiting for someone to buy them.  Freshness is definitely not a high concern amongst them.  Now on to the actual taste of the slider and fries.  The slider was nothing special.  It tastes like an exact replica of the microwavable ones.  The fries were average at best.  They taste so plain, and crispiness is word miles away from the texture of them.  Yelpers, you have been warned.  Proceed at your own risk.  If you are drunk, by all means, you will absolutely love it here.  If you have standards, please head to our friend Ronald.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	1	2015-03-21	0	1

Last time my family and I visited Las Vegas, my brothers went and raved so much about the place. So we just went and honestly, I'm not sure how I feel about the place. The burgers itself were kind of dry but I really did like the grilled onions in it. I just think if there was some sort of sauce in the burgers, it would've been much better. I was expecting much more. However, the price wasn't that bad. We got the combo with 20 burgers and two fries and it cost $25. So that wasn't bad at all. Overall, I'm glad I got to go to the place for the experience but I'm not keen on going back anytime soon.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	3	2016-12-24	1	1

I got the double cheese slider as well and it was meh, I'm not a fan of White Castles Original, Classic, nor Cheeseburgers.. they're just too mushy for me and they smell weird. $10 for 1 double cheese slider, 1 fish slider, 1 chicken slider, and 1 soft drink.I'll be back for the chicken and fish sliders!

Another thing was that there was an employee fighting with a guest telling him to leave. The manager came and told the guy to leave and he said ok. And then then the employee left and came back and started telling the guy inappropriate stuff. That was unnecessary drama, but I still love the burgers !	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	3	2017-05-30	0	0

I immediately walk inside. Take a look at the menu. All I see is these mini burgers. Anyways i went and ordered a combo. 4 small mini burgers fries and a drink. Service was fast. Line got back up but they are quick. Got my food. Had to find a spot to eat since the whole place was pack. This location is a gold mine for white castle. All the tourist walking by get lured in. Burgers was okay. Fries was generic. All this hype for some small burgers made famous by a movie. Give it a try. Only will try once again if a friend choose to eat here. Nothing special!

The line up was long and took about 20 minutes from entering to leaving with my food.  I'm not familiar with their sliders so I decided to get 3 of them and a regular fries.  I thought if I couldn't eat them all, I would share with my husband.  The line up to order was the longest wait, but the cashier was friendly.  After I waited on the side for my order number to be called.  It seems to be an efficient process with staff doing their part of the assembly line to get the food ready and placed in bags.  The woman who calls out the number also provides ketchup packets and is friendly.When I got back to the hotel, I was disappointed with the food.  Each slide had a pickle and onions but the beef didn't look and taste very appetizing.  I was hungry so I did eat up eating all my food but now that I've tried it once, I know I never have to go back.  There's too many other great restaurants and food to be had in Vegas so I'll keep walking by next time I'm in the area.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	2	2016-11-30	1	1

0	wV4uhvJGok8nOR56Ex5mAg	C36ujYeKf33sSpvVZj-xYg	Hellooooooo White Castle! I've been waiting for you to come to the West Coast (or as close as can be to the West Coast) since the Harold and Kumar movie. Yes, it's been THAT long. -_- And those White Castle sliders in the frozen aisle of the grocery store do not do it justice! Located in the Best Western Casino Royale, in between Venetian and Harrah's, they're open 24/7, perfect for late night munchies and as expected for a Vegas spot! There's a direct entrance off the strip so you don't have to go through the casino floor. The direct entrance takes you through the dining area first while you make your way back to the counter to queue up and order. BF went all out for 2 people and got the #9 combo pack, which includes 20 original sliders and 2 orders of french fries. Just 10 sliders short of a crave case cardboard box, which meant our order was packed slightly discreetly in a paper bag with a plastic bag instead. LoL. Sliders come with bun, patty, pickle, and onions. Cheese is an extra $6 (about 33 cents per slider) for the #9 combo and was well worth it! I bit into the slider with low expectations because I've been searching for them for so long and I didn't want to hype up the slider only to be disappointed. I wasn't. Flavorful and all gone in 4 bites (2 for the BF). Enough flavor on its own. You can also politely ask for some sauce (meant for dipping chicken tenders but oh well). I used ranch, BBQ and zesty zing on some of the sliders. Even though we ordered and took it to go, and made the 15 minute trek back to our hotel room to enjoy, the burgers were slightly damp, but still good! How successful were we in finishing the entire order? Maybe 70% of the way through. We dusted off all the fries and had only some sliders left. The remaining 30% was an excellent breakfast/lunch (not brunch since it was a weekday) meal!	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	4	2016-04-26	1	1

I have been to white castle in the past on the east coast they are quick, very inexpensive, and good for a snack. Worth it if you are looking for quantity rather than quality. However this place has none of that!!! Service was slow, Burgers were 3 to 4 times the price of the east coast, the place was a mess, No ice in machine, and the quality was much worse. I guess we should be lucky that we have the only white castle on the west coast but they really need to lower the prices increase the quality and get some Big Red in the soda machines.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	2	2015-06-16	0	0

I'm from Minnesota so to see a White Castle on the West Coast was like was Christmas in July. Finally found a parking spot this is really hard to there is no parking for them White Castle that is. Made it in and see no line, no surprise because White Castle always has a line. To my surprise a young man that was in line at the front front got upset because the people that were working we're laughing and doing nothing instead of working he being frustrated hit his cup off the counter counter. That's what got my attention he started screaming that there's a line of people and the people working are laughing joking not doing anything I noticed this was true they were all in a circle just kind of hanging burgers are sitting on the waiting table ready to be made or should I just say put together cuz they're already made and we're waiting. Fred the manager who was a woman I say that because I think they gave me the wrong name of the young lady but if Fred's the name Fred's the name Fred got mad at the young man for noticing that her workers weren't working and instead of apologizing threatened to give the money back, at first he was reluctant just wanted some ketchup but when that was a chore he said yes give me my money back. I just want to say that this made everyone get hands on deck when I say everyone's hands were moving they were all moving and I don't know if it was because Fred came out or if it was because the young man made a fuss but what I know is that I got my food a little bit quicker than I would have had he had not said anything... and he didn't even get to eat. Very sad to save my hometown restaurant Kansas City Missouri where my family is from, we grew up on White Castles. Bunch of onions piled up in the corner little mustard a pickle man that bread something else. I tell a lot of people about White Castles and everybody says this or says that me I love him Frozen from Minnesota or Frozen from in the grocery store what I don't like is bad customer service and that's exactly what I got at this White Castle with Fred as the manager. It was so bad that the drinks didn't even work and the young man who only was able to get his drink had to be mad about that as well.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	1	2017-07-05	0	0

Their fries are delicious, the sliders are unique, offering a steamed variation on the burger.  And the toppings are minimal yet effective.  For the first time, I got a chicken ring sliders which was pretty good and seemed to offer a sizable piece of chicken.  In N' Out may be a little better, but White Castle is great as well.  Having the closest location to Los Angeles, I stopped at the Vegas White Castle for a Crave Case.  I went for the Cheeseburger Sliders, which run about $41 for a case of 30.  Although I remember them having ketchup, when I asked for them to hold the ketchup, I was informed they came without ketchup, but did have pickles which I did not remember.  These ones were not quite as steamed or good as some of the east coast locations, but hey, I'm eating White Castle so who am I to complain?!  I'm not sure that the pickles were needed and as they sit in my freezer while I work my way through the case, I may regret getting a smaller order and going for the frozen ones at home, but so far I have yet to be too disappointed.  And if anything the mental appeal and novelty of having an authentic White Castle experience awaiting in my freezer will help give it an edge.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	4	2015-05-30	0	0

Recommend everyone try it once to satisfy your curiosity, but the burgers are terribly bland, flavorless, limp, and unexciting.

I don't know if the Las Vegas location does the brand justice, and I might be talking crazy here, but I actually prefer the microwave burgers from the grocery store. The burgers at this restuarant are much greasier, inconsistent (one of my burgers came with pickles, the other did not), and somehow lacked flavor compared to its microwave counterpart. I also tried the chicken rings-just your average chicken nugget. I don't know if it is just a western state thing, but they did offer jalapeno cheese which was a plus. For the size of the burgers, they are certainly overpriced-but I guess that's nothing new.Because it's Vegas, they have beer on tap, but it is of the cheap variety. But then again, it is fast food after all. I will eventually give this brand another chance in the mid-west.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	2	2016-01-19	0	0

I think there was more hype about how great they were that made me want to give it a try. When I heard about White Castle opening in Vegas I thought I should try it from the real place instead of a food truck. So I went with a friend opening day. The line wrapped around the building. We waited for about an hour and a half but moved pretty fast considering the line of people. While waiting it was nice to see some of the staff coming out to talk to us and we're so enthusiastic about opening. When we finally got to the front I had to try one of everything. Almost everything. We got the original sliders , fries, loaded fries and chicken rings. Once we had the food to ourselves we indulged. Loved the chicken rings and who doesn't love fries. The loaded fries tasted good but I could have done without the bacon,sadly it didn't taste like good crispy bacon we all love. Annnnnd then the sliders...they tasted just as I remembered from the foodie fest. Luke warm and wet, almost soggy bread. I'm an optimist so I do wanna go back and try it again and hope it was only like that due to the craziness of opening day. If not, definitely munchie or drunk food. P.S. Get a beer! The way they serve it is pretty awesome.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	3	2015-02-11	0	0

Came here before heading home from Vegas and I thought it was perfect for a hangover. It is fast food so don't expect anything fancy or high quality ingredients.

3	ZngF2uBYrqyFjXd6LvuluQ	gqVqMV6wS_ffSI7O_Nyj5g	So yeah.  White Castle.  Uhm it's a thing here now.  Honestly it has been a thing here for about a decade.  I say this because it tastes exactly the same as the frozen microwave burgers.  Exactly? Well not really because there is a pickle in these ones.  The location is on the strip in the small casino north of the Venetian by the Linq parking lot. It's very fast paced and as soon as we ordered we weren't able to fill up our drinks halfway before our order of 20 cheese sliders, 9 piece chicken rings, onion chips and fries were done.  To say the least it was not the most rewarding way for me to break my pescetarian seafood diet.  At best it could be said that you could enjoy the satisfaction that us West coasters can now join the likes of dining in an East coast fast food institution.  Not as rewarding as the opposite experience is for East coasters trying a Double Double & Animal Style Fries from In & Out for the first time.  We got hugely full sharing a 10 pack of sliders for 2 and the baby loved the chicken rings though.  We brought the second 10 pack home for my little bro.  Sadly he had to microwave them slightly by then.  Completely rehashing the same old feeling of eating them the frozen way.  He noted that it was cheaper and more convenient to have just got them at the freezer section.  They may even use the exact ingredients at the restaurant?It was fun.  Everyone should try it at least once.  I may rather stick to a grilled cheese w/ grilled onions with Animal Style fries & a 7up next time without the strip traffic though.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	3	2015-02-28	4	5

So basically the burgers are like sliders on Hawaiian type bread. Drunk and stoner food all the way dude! I liked the burgers, they come 4 in a combo pack. Why is there not one in So. Cal? Go figure... This area of the strip is kind of sketchy, although close to the High Roller.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	4	2016-06-11	0	0

9	825Ol4rTvAZnUyFMke37jA	USOKx8i4GgbFrLyru2P1JA	2016 Yelp 100 Review Challenge -     47/100I had no idea these palm size burgers existed till I watched Harold and Kumar in the theater, 10+ years ago! Because of that movie (one of my fave movies btw), I have also been a fan of White Castle before trying those bite size burgers. Luckily, before they opened up shop in Vegas, I had to settle for the frozen squares at the local market. Now that we are lucky to have our own White Castle, I finally got to try them! I was not disappointed. I knew what to expect and I can say that they taste a little better than the frozen - microwave version I tried before. Still a fan. It's convenient if you're walking the Strip. Once you pass this, you're gonna wanna pop in and grab a couple to continue your walk.  There are toppings available. Try them if you haven't before. Prices are reasonable. Keep in mind, it's on the Strip. The only thing missing was a photo booth with Harold and Kumar! haha John Cho..... :-)	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	4	2016-09-06	6	5
0	PXG-QAqIfk8LC7XkD-WnTQ	5BkOQ7X1YPUeybR65FeBbA	I feel compelled to review this White Castle mainly because of the stream of slightly negative reviews.  First things first, White Castle does not serve a killer gourmet 16 ingredient big burger.  They're small simple classic sliders from the oldest American fast food chain.  People who have had them both crave it and are nostalgic for it.  Bottom line is to appreciate for what it is.  Simple.We went here on a Harold and Kumar esk trek from Downtown LV.  The location is convenient to guests of the Casino Royale or any strip hotel connected to it.  Way less convenient for all others.  We parked in Harrah's which is fairly close and you can walk to the joint inside the casino as Harrah's and Casino Royale are connected.  Parking is free and the walk is less than 5 mins. I've heard a lot about the insane lines so we opted to go when all others are asleep at 5am.  Yes, burgers for breakfast!!  Walked up and ordered in less than 2 minutes and food served 5 minutes after that.  Employees were friendly and obviously over whelmed by the onslaught of customer pouring in all day.  I was impressed they were so positive and that's certainly not been my experience in White Castles past.  The crew were bantering with each other making for a positive vibe which was nice especially if you've getting beat down by the casinos.I'd say enjoy the multitude of employees that are working in anticipation of the crowds because when it's slow its still fresh and super fast.There's a couple of workers constantly cleaning so the place is well kept and clean.  Another nice change based on my past experiences with this chain else where.The set up can make the view from the strip looking in deceiving.  While it may look like there's a large crowd it could just be people eating their food and standing around.  The dining area is toward the strip and the ordering area is inward.  I'd say a good rule is if you see a line extending out doors then ok it's a long line.  Else you should check inside cause the line may not be that long.We had the 20 originals with 2 fries combo for $28.  Just over a buck each which is standard.  They could gouge us but I'm glad to see they didn't.  We have eaten these many times so having these without being in the mid west is a treat indeed.   These little suckers and simple and tasty.  Soft bun, slim patty, grilled onions and a garlic-esk seasoning makes em tasty.  They pretty much melt in your mouth which I love.  Swallow em whole I say (I can't btw)!  Average person can probably eat about 3-5.  We had 10 each.  Don't Judge!!!  We weren't drunk or stoned.Fries are crinkle cut and crispy.  Add some salt.  Get one order fries for every 5 sliders.Bottom line is that it's a White Castle for those who have had em.  The same except this one is very modern and much cleaner than those I've been.  For Noobs, don't buy into the hype.  Keep in mind, where these are from, they are very convenient, never crowded, and relatively cheap.  Don't expect a miracle in a burger and you'll find they are great by their own right.  These things have character like that cool friend everyone knows but nobody sees.  Looking forward to having more next time I'm in town.  Congrats Vegas!  Lucky you.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	3	2015-02-16	2	0

The lines can get really long here, but it does move pretty quickly, the staff is very helpful and friendly. Ultimately, the product is lacking.

Now, taking in account this location is on The Strip, I had to remind myself not to pick it apart for being overcrowded after all there are tons of hungry tourist to feed.Once you get your burgers, it's typical White Castle- cheap and delicious. I just hope they make one off The Strip for those of us who just want their burger goodness minus all the tourist.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	3	2015-08-11	2	2

Although prices were a little higher than other White Castles, it was a welcome price break from the more spendy food options on the Strip.The lines were long, but what other White Castle can you also buy beer? Enjoy the signature steamed square burger sliders, strongly flavored with chopped white onion. We particularly liked the fish slider which I thought was a cut above McDonald's Filet-O-Fish. The crinkle fries were okay. 'Try the crunchy onion bits. Although it isn't fancy, White Castle sliders hit the spot when you need a bite when you are on a tight budget.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	3	2017-07-10	4	1

Prior I had only had White Castle from the frozen section but frozen can never measure up to the freshly prepared sliders. So on my first night out in Vegas for my company's annual trip and after a jillion glasses of Rieslings later, my boss (who is from Detroit) took me and my co workers here. We walked all the way from New York New York! Since it was my first time going to a White Castle restaurant I kept it simple and ordered six sliders and fries. The sliders were even better than the packaged ones! I think is the the fresh onions that give the sliders that bang. However I would say the fries were nasty because they were hard and cold. I complained about it all night. There was no wait because we received our food pretty fast. Hey a drunk can't tell no tales.

0	sXTlMCrrCbYd7LIs3omlSA	PS_yqp2oWYYNXSYVt0p6mw	Growing up in the West, I've never really gotten to experience White Castle fresh. I've only experienced the frozen kind that you buy at your local markets. With that said, and with rave reviews of friends and family, my experience here was anti climatic. I'll have to admit that the fresh ones were slightly better than the frozen one you make at home. These famous sliders are steamed on a bed of grilled onions with a very thin slice of hamburger,  (And I mean thin. I suppose so that it could cook faster) and topped with a bun to also steam. If you want cheese, that is extra. Your slider also contains a pickle. If you want double meat that would be extra as well. I had order the cheese slider combo. It came with 4 sliders, fries or onion chips, and a drink. This cost about $9. Prices are a bit high for what you are receiving. That is to be expected considering it is on the Las Vegas Strip. It's always busy and within one of the casino in Vegas.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	3	2016-04-17	0	0

The line was long but very orderly, and moved consistently. Not as bad as Disneyland. The employees and volunteers were awesome. Everyone had a great attitude. It took about 40 mins to get to the front of the line, then once inside there was another small line of about 20 people deep.Right before we got inside, they started giving out free regular sliders as samples. I seriously thought about getting out of line after the sample. The beef is literally 1/8"""" thick. It's $1.09 for a plain slider, $1.50 for one with cheese. You would have to layer probably three patties to get it the same thickness of say a $1 burger at McD's.  Imagine if you ordered a $1 burger at a fast food place and got a White Castle style slider. You'd be pissed right? But people are lining up for these and buying them by the box! You can add on extra pickles or onions for no charge, otherwise there is only one pickle. No sauce either, but you can ask for ketchup, mayo, etc.They have $5 shakes too, but no bourbon in them.

I ordered a variety of things: onion rings, chicken nugget like things and two sliders.Onion rings, unfortunately these were the highlight of my meal....they were the best tasting thing I ordered and even then they were just okay.The chicken nuggets tasted very stale and were pretty small too.

The western most outpost of the east coast chain is at the Casino Royale between Harrah's and the Venetian.Veterans know what to expect. White Castle specializes in small burgers called sliders with a thin beef patty grilled in onions. You order several paired with fries or chicken rings, although I always recommend doubling down on the sliders as the fries are rather basic.The real value comes from the large packs of sliders. You can get a bag or case of them to take back to the room for a cheap price. The restaurant is nice to eat in with basic decorations and easy access.It's nice to see some east coast classics make their way to Las Vegas. White Castle is not the best burger on the strip, but it's comforting to have them as a fun option while visiting.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	4	2017-07-18	11	9

I was staying at the palazzo so I decided to wake up extra early at 7am on a Sunday to stand in line to get some mini burgers. I arrived and was so excited that there was no line. Not even one person in front of me. I decided to order the crave case. It came with 30 sliders for $34.99. The workers are really fast at what they are doing and got me my case of sliders super fast. I took a bite and was really disappointed. It didn't have much flavors and the ones I have made at home were so much better than from the actually white castle. Overall, I will not be back.

The food is just how I remember it last time I had it driving through New Jersey.  I got the yummy crinkle fries and those cheese sliders kissed with onion steam.  Mmmm.  The line went pretty quickly, and the cashier was friendly.  Love the castle facade on the Strip!  It's connected to the Best Western/Casino Royale's food court, which let's face it, is not the most stellar hotel/casino out here.  I did go out of my way just for this food, but it was worth it to me.  Again, just the fact that it's out here is worth a lot.

5	I0JqG0FOL1FXDTTi_VVJhg	DRyF25xToznKWQZVJNCMdA	I see a lot of bad ratings about this place and while I can see how some people might feel, I think they got it all wrong. I mean you can't compare it to anything else which some do talking about how you can get bigger better burgers. You don't come here for a double double, you don't come here for a 1/2 lb patty. These are White Castle sliders. This is what you come here for. These mini perfect two bite sliders steamed on a bed of onions. The next complaint I hear is about the price being more expensive then back east. This is the Las Vegas strip. It's not cheap to be here. Let them make their money. It's not insane. Meals are about $8-$10. A damn McDonald's meal can come out to almost $7 or $8 off the strip, give them a break! In fact it's the same price or maybe even a little cheaper than when it comes to the foodie festival and no one complains about that. And this is a legit White Castle. Not a truck just serving the sliders. The sliders are the real deal. The sides are good, small, but good. The service is impeccable. Even with long lines you get your food in 5-10 minutes. I got mines in 3. It's kept as clean as possible considering the crowd that comes through here. The bottom line is this is secured in my places to eat at and I'm more than thankful to have it so close to me. The only reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is the casino it's in, and the type of crowd that comes from that casino. You'll see what I mean. To get an idea, as I write this review, there have been literally thousands of people who have gone here and only 55 yelp reviews. So they're not exactly the courteous foodie type. But it's White Castle, and it's here, the farthest west it's ever been. Try it. Love it. Carry on.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	4	2015-02-06	6	5
0	aotan8ob5thZBvQKFdtbwQ	7Mpha2oC77j5VvdT9B7gpw	Not sure if lackluster taste or just sober.I've gone to White Castle locations in the East Coast a few years back and remember tasting the sweetness of caramelized onions with that salty square patty and having a huge smile on my face from the first slider to the last. This time around... not so much.Granted it is a fast food chain and not much should be expected but nonetheless I'm voicing a little disappointment. I'm sure after knocking a few back through the night this place would have been a godsend but not when I'm sober and chauffeuring people from out of town trying to explain that this chain had a whole movie revolving around it. The sliders do come somewhat neatly packed into their signature boxes and it's always a fun time when you take 20 of them to make a nice castle to DESTROY. We opted for half regular and half with cheese for this order. Fries were under-seasoned and kind of took me back to the days of my childhood eating cafeteria food... you know what... let's just call this experience that.Having White Castle on the Las Vegas strip in the early evening is like over-paying for the same $2.50 slider and fry combo you would buy at your school cafeteria during lunch. I wouldn't say it's terrible but it's not that great either. In our case, we went for the number 9* pack for 4 people and still left a bit hungry and our international friends very disappointed (sorry folks).*Drinks and cheese are extra	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	3	2016-01-06	0	0

Food out here in the desert costs more in grocery stores and most fast food chains.  Quality and taste? Well, the slider was on the dry side and the onions didn't exist. I'm not a fan of them anyhow and only stop in to see if the fish and clams are available yet.  Having no other choice, I pick up a few sliders.  Far from the worse place I've ever been, but anyone who's been to the ones in NYC will know the difference.  The """" good ole boys"""" here in Vegas think it's a great place to eat and talk all day about """" no state income tax"""" here. But that 900 a year to register there truck is fine and dandy along with all the other super inflated city and state fees.  Point is .....ignorance is bliss.  If you don't know what a real White Castle is, you'll be happy.  Every real NY'er I know thinks this Vegas location sucks. Will I be back? Not for a slider. Hopefully the fish and clams will be here.  Then again, they'll probably fuck those up too and charge 40% more for them since we're sitting in this """" rock quarry"""" called Las Vegas."""	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	2	2016-01-07	0	0

Waited in line for 5 minutes and decided to order combo #2- 4 White Castle cheeseburgers, fries, and a drink. The very friendly attendant recommended the onion chips instead of their regular crinkle cut fries. Great recommendation!  It's like onion rings but in wedge form. Burgers were nothing spectacular; steamed mini buns with grilled onions, processed cheese, a pickle, and a ham-like slice of hamburger. This place is overrated but makes a good and inexpensive snack (individual burgers are $1.29). Do keep in mind that each burger is the size of a dinner bun.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	3	2015-12-27	0	0

I had no idea what to expect as I only knew of White Castle through H&K so I went in with an open mind. The line to the register wasn't horribly long and it gave me enough time to look up at the menu. Since I only wanted to try the burgers I just went for a very small meal option that consisted of a burger and fries.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	3	2015-11-22	0	0

0	SABphgjl1eYNqD8wdpQrxw	IVhW8LcTLk1nPaanEkBFeQ	We're from San Diego, so my boyfriend was eager to eat White Castle that wasn't out of a food truck----it tasted the same lol. I wasn't impressed because a burger can only go so far with flavor, especially White Castle's concept with simple sliders with just meat, buns, optional cheese, onions and pickles. But they're still good and easy to eat. They're also fun to eat. Their food is a cute portion, which allows you to order more of them, or just sticking to a nice small portion that we should be eating haha. Taste-wise: their burgers honestly taste like McDonald's dollar cheeseburgers to me, BUT BETTER. I stress the better because i'm comparing them to McDonald's. White Castle has better buns, better meat, and better sides for sure. Their onion chips are my faaaaavorite. The chicken rings are okay, dry if anything but a good change if you want chicken as your side. And their french fries remind me of cafeteria fries, and i like cafeteria food. White Castle is cheap, which is a plus. They aren't trying to sell gourmet food so don't expect gourmet burgers. They're just simple, small, and not bad at all. I can see White Castle doing very well in SoCal and be highly competitive with all of SoCal's other burger joints, seriously. It would be a nice addition to fast food joints i can choose from. I'm just deducting one star because their food isn't anything out of the ordinary (what do you expect with fast food though?)--but i'm sure that wasn't their goal to begin with, sober at least.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	4	2015-09-01	1	0

One of the best things about their slider is how the bun melts a little into the hot burger.  For whatever reason they weren't nearly as hot as they should be.  Lost the flavor and the smell. A $5+ dollar shake, each burger was 50 cents over regular WC's and not as good, it wasn't a place were you were eating fun for a few bucks anymore.I'll wait till I'm back in NY for my next one.  Didn't want to be disappointed but . . .If you're familiar with White Castle and love them, you won't want to get familiar with this one.   Keep the memory of how they were.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	1	2015-02-16	1	0

This place can be really packed at times.  Try going later or really early if you don't want a line wrapped around the building outside.There's very little sitting and just be really friendly with other diners.  We sat near a gentleman from LA in town for a concert. We chatted before his food came out. He bought one of everything on the menu which I realized was accurately smart. He ate his food and didn't even touch his bacon cheese fries, he was so full he gave us the bacon cheese fries.We were so full after we left and it pays to be friendly with neighboring people.  We had a number #7  ten sliders pack, cheese was a $3 up charge.  I think I had 5 little cheese sliders they had pickles and onions.

Finally made it to one in Las Vegas and for a late night snack it was good. Simple yet good. Nothing else really tastes like it.

They were tasty, and not bad at all, but they just tasted like the boxed ones that you can pick up at Vons, only with someone else heating them up for you.

It also gets a 2 instead of a 1 because it was very organized. The line looked really long, but we were only in line for about 10-15 minutes and then it took maybe another 5 to get the actual food.So here's the deal. My husband and I have lived in So-Cal all our lives, so even though we've always heard of White Castle---the East Coast version of In n Out, we had never gotten to try it. We were SUPER excited when we randomly saw they had one in Vegas that we had to stop and try it! Yay!We had seen the frozen ones at Ralphs for years, but didn't ever want to ruin our first experience for when we did eventually get to try the real thing....in hindsight I feel like the frozen ones might actually be better!We weren't very hungry so we just ordered 2 cheese sliders and 1 double cheese slider with no onions for me. PROTIP: Yes you can order individually even though they aren't on the menu that way.We were lucky enough to instantly find a table (it was packed), sat down, and dug in. Upon first bite we both looked at each other with a WTF look on our faces. We had waited years to try this? Avoided the frozen version? Waited in line. Ew.The buns were soggy and wet, the meat was gray. Not a good combination. Like I said we didn't spit them out, so I guess it gets a 2 star, but OMG they were pretty close to terrible. This is what all the hype is about? I admit I think they're cute in those little boxes, but the compliments pretty much end there. I think I figured it out though...you must have to be high riding on white tigers like Harold and Kumar to be able to say you enjoyed those things.Thanks but no thanks White Castle...ew.In N Out for the win....West Coast 4eva!	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	2	2015-02-22	3	2

You can get a way better burger for cheaper at Shack Shake, Steak N Shake, Fatburger, or even McDonalds, if you want a late night meal, Del Taco is better than White Castle. I think people rate it in the nostalgia feeling and the memories, because it's totally not worth it. The line did move fast and it was clean, but based on taste, no way. You're in Vegas, were you can get a gourmet burger for $6.99  (at Flemings Steakhouse)  or a decent burger at local bars for the same price.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	2	2015-02-17	1	0

Apparently customer service isn't that important when you're selling thousands of hamburgers a day.________Being originally from Chicago, I've been dying to get here, but wanted to wait until the craziness died down.  I finally made it over for lunch at Noon.  Believe it or not, my wait was only about 5 minutes.  Yes, they were busy (and the line grew for lunchtime as I was there), but still not the hours it was when it opened. It's definitely more expensive than the typical WC, but understandable both being on the Strip & delivering the food from the Midwest.  With that said, the burgers & onion ri..., er, chips are how I remembered--fantastic.  The frozen ones in the stores don't even compare.The workers were friendly & the place clean.

The five of us dropped in for a snack following a show at the Venetian.  Queued up and looked at overhanging menu posted above.  Combo pack = 10 burgers, two fountain drinks, and two orders of fries could satisfy our palates.The order taker asked if we wanted cheese.  O.k.   Total came to about $24.00.Almost $5.00 per person for a what we got didn't seem worth it to me.  I'll pass next time.  But those are the kind of prices even for junk food in Vegas.Mystery burger meat shaped thin and square.  The chopped onions and the pickle made up for it.  Soft burger bun.  Maybe two to four bites depending on your bite.  Served in individual cardboard boxes.  I say save money and use paper.  Need to be more eco friendly.The kitchen was working hard.

The cheese slider #2 combo with fries comes with grilled onions and a pickle inside the sliders.  If I had a choice between In n Out or Smashburgers I would choose those 2 over this.

No appeal what so ever. Even a hamburger at nasty McDonald's would be cheaper and more flavorful. The sliders are literally the size of a half dollar coin, and takes less than a bite to eat. Like you read in the other reviews, the meat is paper thin, our sliders had barely any grilled onions in it, and the bread was soggy. It tasted like literally paper. If it was actually the same prices of the east coast white castles then I could see the appeal in getting filled by buying like a million sliders for cheap although you're wasting it on eating a pile of flavorless junk.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	2	2015-02-09	3	0

No longer do you need to fly out to the east coast 4 hours away or eat microwavable frozen white castle from the grocery.  Harold and Kumar can finally get their fix in Sin City. While the location in Best Western Hotel is a little bit awkward, it's also quite convenient being that there is parking in the back. I came here in the morning before heading back out to Los Angeles. The staff was in full force and looked like they were ready for a big crowd to come through.

But most often, your order comes up pretty quick.Personally, I always opt for one of the meal deals - usually the one with 4 sliders.

We'd watch it every single week after our Sunday league soccer games and always dreamed of going on a road trip to get 100's of those tasty looking  little sliders.Unfortunately, that dream never did come true but 12 years later the reminiscing angels opened up the heavens and decided to let the King and Queen of White Castle land one of their castles on the Las Vegas strip!! Hallelujah right??! ....OH... HELL.... NO! The spot is located inside the Casino Royale  Hotel, right across the street from the Mirage so it's pretty centrally located. It wasn't too busy when we went but it seems like the line goes very fast any ways. Maybe sipping on a fruity Phat Tuesday at the same time as ordering wasn't the brightest idea but either way the food here is absolutely disgusting. I was EXTREMELY excited...remembering almost every line from Harold and Kumar as I waited for my food to be ready to grab. That excitement did a complete 180 Right after opening the bag, as it smelled like landfill or some type of sewage leak but of course I ignored it and proceeded to pull a couple regular sliders out of the bag and a chicken ring slider as well. Even though I was really hungry this stuff was so hard to swallow and digest. The sliders are almost as bad as dog food, actually I wouldn't even feed this to a poor little pup. The chicken ring sliders weren't as horrible but still tasted like dry cardboard. I now understand why Harold and Kumar craved this place when they were high, because being high has to be the ONLY POSSIBLE WAY TO ENJOY THE FOOD HERE.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	1	2015-05-10	5	3

The lines are about 20 minutes long and the sliders were similar to the ones you get in the frozen food section. Pretty disappointed in this place but I already expected it. The sliders looked like they were just slapped together. The only thing I liked about it was that they came in mini boxes. The meat was small and mysterious. We picked up a bag of hot cheetos to put it in our sliders to cover up the taste and it worked. I got the Combo #2 (~$8.99) which includes 4 cheese sliders, fries and a soda. Next time I'll pass on this. Overall, will not come back to this location. I would give White Castle another try but in the East Coast.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	2	2016-07-18	5	1

Well it's located in the middle of the Vegas strip which is why it's crazy busy in there. So ordered the cheese burger combo number 2. The party is thin and the look of it was different from the kind of patty I am used to look at. Bun was soft but from the heat and being in a paper box and it was a bit too soft or bit soggy. Fries were awesome, they tasted so good.I would come here again maybe. But I am not a big fan of their sliders. Not sure what's the hype.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	3	2015-12-31	0	0

(Duh, Haven't you ever seen Harold & Kumar, and the lengths they went to just to get a damn slider). Anywho, I have only been able to eat these little suckers from the frozen food section since moving from NY so it was nice to see (and eat) fresh burgers from the stand.  This was the first placed I stopped at and they brought back nostalgia. Chicken Rings, Cheese burger, fries and AGITA (thats HEARTBURN) It didnt get 5 stars because the prices are INSANE. Also, to make your burgers LESS murderous on your intestines, Order them WITHOUT onions. That's the key :)	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	3	2015-04-07	0	0

What were you expecting? This ain't In-N-Out.My only beef with this place - no pun intended, but I could have deleted it and used another phrase if I really wanted to - is that they serve onion chips, which are whole chunks of onion covered in bread crumbs, instead of onion rings, which are built around processed, probably reconstituted onions. It's a nod to quality but I miss the old school rings.And of course now I want White Castle. The crave is too real.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	5	2016-04-12	0	0

Yeah, the meat is a super-thin mystery but it's a nostalgia thing, there's nothing like the WC flavor. Summers in Ohio with my cousins would always end with a trip here. Back home in Texas, my dad would crave them and have to settle for the frozen-aisle version. Finally, Vegas got an outpost! The prices are jacked up for the Strip location but the taste is all 1994. It really is a trip to finally be able to taste real White Castle burgers again: hot, fresh, crusted in onion bits and topped with a single pickle. You gotta get them with cheese for the full effect. Add ketchup at your own risk!Service is pretty organized: the kitchen is open and everyone is working hard, order numbers are both called out and posted on a screen. Somehow I got skipped, but they remade my order and tossed in dessert, too.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	4	2015-12-23	10	10

White Castle is one of those late night craving fixers that used to not exist in the western USA, leave it to Vegas to make it happen. This place is a bit of a show in the middle of the night as most people are drunk and sloppy while ordering lol. The food itself is as expected, small but tasty, usually takes 4-5 of these bad boys to get you full. This is likely the only reason to go into the Casino Royale, as it is located within. Overall, recommend as a late night novelty fix, not necessarily if you're looking for a delicious burger.

He thought they looked good and he did not want to try the frozen ones as he wanted the authentic experience. They were such a waste of money and calories! We got the 10 pack of hamburgers for $11, and a large fries for $2.95 which would of been the same as getting a number #1 and 2 extras for myself and come out with less food. We waited 30 minutes for our food and when we got it and ate it, we were so unsatisfied with the flavor. IT tasted just like onions, thats it! so overpowering. Will not go back!

The only time I could get a White Castle was when I was in Chicago for a tradeshow. I simply had to hit the Vegas location up for these tasty little sliders.Loaded Fries are topped with cheese sauce, ranch, and bacon. I love the crinkle cut fries which holds the sauce and toppings really well. Nothing better than cheesy fries, unless they are topped with chili too. Rating: 5/5Double Original Slider is two beef patties with an extra piece of bread in the middle and topped with onions and pickle. Patties are steam grilled with the onions which adds more flavor to the patty. The buns are put on top to steam as well. The whole slider is just juicy and soft. There are imitators but this is the original! Rating: 3/5Double Cheese Slider is two beef patties with an extra piece of bread in the middle and topped with cheese, onions, and pickle. When I bit into the first one, I was in foodie heaven. There is nothing like the juicy beef flavor with the grilled onions and gooey cheese. I was being good, but I could have easily eaten a couple more of these. Rating: 5/5	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	4	2015-05-29	1	0

We were highly disappointed after paying for 30 sliders to open the bag once we got on the road to find only 16 in the bag. The same great white castle taste is there, but we missed out on half of our order. I tried for over 30 minutes while waiting at the airport to contact the manager without success.

You either hate these or like them, I highly doubt anyone LOVES these burgers. I wanted to get these because it's been about 20 years since I moved to California where there are no White Castles. I almost forgot about this business until Harold and Kumar came along and I got the frozen ones a few times a year. I actually liked their sliders as a kid...obviously they look much tinier now.Anyway, we didn't like them enough to eat the 8 we got (I consider 4 of them as an equivalent to one normal burger) We took it back to our hotel room and I chucked the remainder in the freezer....I got hungry the next day and decided to microwave one up for 40 seconds....Maybe it's just me, but it tasted better after the freezer.For those people complaining about the patty's color, it's because of the way it's made, doesn't mean the meat is inferior (most fast food patties are all roughly the same quality). They lay down the minced and semi cooked onions on the flat cooking area, cook and reduce the juices a bit, then lay the frozen patties on top of the onions, then they lay the bread on top and let the onion steam cook the patty, thus the gray color. Meat only gets brown if it's directly on the cooking surface."""	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	3	2015-12-02	1	1

I honestly wasn't expecting much. I feel like when places like this are talked about so much the food is generally mediocre. My boyfriend and I decided to give this place a try as a late night snack. We got there around 11 and there was a huge line. The wait was not bad at all though. The line looks long, but they make the burgers pretty quick so it goes by really fast.I opted for two of their original cheese sliders and they came out really quick. The burgers are really small so I understand why they have such huge combos. I am normally a person who doesn't eat much and I think I could eat about 4 sliders. The patty is really thin and that is what makes the sliders stand out. There was nothing special about them, but they were the perfect late night snack. I will probably be back here when I am in Vegas and craving a light snack in the middle of the night since they are open 24hrs. I am curious about how their other sliders and fries taste like so I might revisit the next time I visit Vegas in July. With so many food choices near by, White Castle would probably not be the first place that comes to my mind when I want a full meal.Overall, White Castle is A-OK in my book.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	3	2017-05-25	1	1

You have to find some where to park on the strip and walk which is fine, but like I stated quick bite it isn't happening. Now to the food, Burgers are pretty decent no onions for me, but the onion flavor is echoing off the bun which gives it that classic White Castle aroma. Instead of hard microwave buns now they are soft and fresh and the burger is made right in front of me instead of in a factory  which makes it a plus. Now to the best item at White Castle the Chicken Rings. It reminded me of the old recipe Chicken Nuggets at BK. Reminded me of my childhood which resulted in yet another plus. Overall good spot for the Tourists and the tipsy crowd walking by."""	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	3	2015-10-03	0	0

However, it's a way for people not from the Midwest or the East Coast to experience this cornerstone of American culture and history.I was quite disappointed when I tasted the overly hyped White Castle offering at Las Vegas Foodie Fest. It was very mediocre and I couldn't believe that they would eat this stuff fanatically. When they decided to open an actual restaurant in response to the crowds, I decided that I'd have to give it a shot. Perhaps the sliders at Foodie Fest weren't quite """"the real thing.""""I parked at Harrah's. You might consider the Mirage across the street, the Venetian to the north, or the Linq slightly farther south, but I think Harrah's is pretty convenient. I happened to bypass the line (it's possible if you take a side door or just walk through Casino Royale) because I wasn't looking to stand in line at all. The line was watched by private security and extended onto the sidewalk outside the """"White Castle"""" door.The menu prices tend to be absurd, so I was really glad that Antonia R. and Renzo were kind enough to share some of their large order. Not that anyone should wander in here alone, but you really should share a 10-slider sack or a """"Crave Case"""" of 30 sliders with friends/family if you don't want to end up paying $8 for four tiny sliders, awful fries, and a cheap soda.In light of that comment, I'll discuss the sides first. The french fries are really, really bad. They're soggy crinkle-cut fries with barely any crispiness or salt. Pretty much every other fast food chain can beat this handily. The onion chips, on the other hand, are surprisingly awesome. They're crunchy and not overly greasy. They're like onion rings but in a small enough size so that you won't have that issue of eating the entire onion portion while trying to bite the onion ring into smaller pieces. Definitely skip the fries and get the onion chips if you come here.As I'd anticipated, the sliders here had much more flavor than whatever they were serving before. You can taste some savory flavors from the almost paper-thin patties, enjoy the soft bun, and notice the grilled onions and pickle. I actually found the cheese on the cheese sliders to be a distraction. The cheese just obscured the other flavors without providing much flavor of its own. Order the original sliders.Look, you really shouldn't go here unless you've never been to White Castle. You'll get more meat at a lower price at pretty much any other fast food place, even those on the Strip. But if you do decide that you must have the experience, make sure you're aware of the prices and strongly consider bringing a group."""	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	3	2015-02-09	10	2
1	f-8BKEVPqiqRaNNmhjAU8Q	PR5gJejinbqabO6DU_tpcQ	White Castle had been on my bucket list for years. When I heard they recently opened a location in Vegas my smile grew big as I bookmarked it and forgot about it for a few months. We decided to head out to Vegas last weekend sporadically and I knew I had to find it on the strip and try it. Luckily, without planning our hotel was not too far from the White Castle that we stumbled upon our first night in town casino hopping. It is located inside the Royale Casino, which was another amazing find (cheap drinks), but that will be another review.  We got in a long line and waited eagerly. We ordered a number 9 which included 20 original sliders and 2 regular French fries for $25.99. We added cheese and the total was around $35. Amanda took our order. She was patient, polite, and informative on our questions. Give Amanda a raise. We took our booty back to our room and began to pig out after a long night. I was surprised to bite into pickles on the burgers. Prior, I had only tried the frozen White Castle burgers, no pickles came on them. After the two of us devoured all we could we quickly realized that we had ordered way too much food for two people. There were MANY burgers left over. I am glad I checked this one off my list, and didn't have to travel to the East Coast to do so. It was not the best food but for being hungry in Vegas it hit the spot.*The french fries were not good at all. Wish we had tried another side instead.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	3	2015-08-17	3	0

You can see the chefs in the back cooking and boxing all the orders so I would say it's not exactly """"fresh"""" because they're just constantly making the same thing over and over again.

You get a lot of food in your meal but it taste like your average fast food that you can easily get from any fast food restaurant. Some of the employees seem very impatient but you can't really expect much from a fast food restaurant that's always packed. It is worth the experience in Vegas to say the least. If I'm starving at 3 or 4 in the morning with no other option the next time I visit Vegas, I might give it a second chance?	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	3	2017-07-18	0	0

All of my bodily senses tell me I shouldn't like it. I mean, the famous sliders were soggy and tasteless, and yet I came away from it all kinda enjoying the experience. In a way, I can understand the appeal. If you're completely famished, it's easier to stuff yourself with White Castle sliders than with any other fast food burger precisely because of the very traits that make it so unappealing to foodies. Dunno if I'll ever come back, but regardless of all the bad reviews anyone who liked Harold and Kumar owes it to themselves to try the food at least once.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	3	2015-03-25	0	0
0	rx6TW2QmrfImGX0dvLyPQg	FUiLdI-xo65mKEAmpGcUaA	I surprisingly enjoyed my first ever White Castle.First I'd like to say I'm not a fan of fast food chains. I eat at a drive through fast food chain maybe 5 times a year tops when I have absolutely no other option on a road trip. So for me to go & say I enjoyed is rare.My gal friend & I were looking for something inexpensive on the strip & checked it out. She's from the east coast so she's familiar & of course with the Harold & Kumar movies I wanted to try it at least once. We stopped in here. It was packed but the wait wasn't too bad. I ordered two veggie sliders. I was told that I'd have to wait an extra 10 mins or so because they don't get ordered often so they take a little more time. That was no problem. We also got onion chips, fries, mozzarella sticks, & drinks & normal sliders for her. While we waited we talked to some nice older gentlemen who sat next to us since it was so full they needed a place at our table to have anywhere to eat. They told us about how back in the day when they were young they went to White Castle after getting stoned & also told us about the old uniforms. They were really funny & nice so that was a fun quirk of being there.I enjoyed the veggie sliders. They had edamame in them which I eat regularly so that was a nice treat. I'm not a huge fan of black bean burgers so edamame was a nice alternative! I loved having a veggie option available so I give lot's of props to White Castle for doing that when many other places will not consider people who do not eat (don't eat a lot) of meat. The onion chips & fries were very American style & since I don't eat those types of foods often they tasted good for the rare occasion. If I ever needed a quick, inexpensive bite with a vegetarian option I would stop by here again.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	4	2016-07-13	0	0

Had the opportunity to introduce White Castle to my wife and my son this summer! I remember getting them for .10 cents a burger. lol. I will admit that it is a little pricey but then again, you are paying to be on The Strip. I wanted to add an additional side note on the service. Of  the 3 times I have visited White Castle here on the strip, I have had the fortunate pleasure of having Nohemi take my order at the counter. She is an absolute doll!

You can buy them as part of a combo or get a pack....like a 100. I kid you not. It is on the menu. Personally, I'd opt for a combo with 4 of these mini burgers plus a side and a drink.You have to eat it hot otherwise it does not taste good. The bread is soft like those Hawaiian rolls.

There's a part of me that was curious as I grew up in California where we don't have these. Ordering was pretty efficient and I got my order in a matter of minutes.I've only ever had the microwaved ones to go by and there are pretty much the same slider with cheese in taste minus 2 things - these had pickles in it and the bread is softer since it wasn't frozen. I don't know if that is a positive feat that a microwaved product taste the same so you can have these anywhere or that it's pretty bad that I can see something cook up fresh on a grill and have it be no better than what I can reheat at home. Fries were pretty standard crinkle fries.Maybe nostalgia is way more powerful and brainwashy in other people but I didn't really get this one. I already don't really get the crazy fandom of other fast foods, but I think some of those are justified after this.  In N Out, Five Guys are actually pretty good fast and fresh options so I understand how that can be satisfying. Cheap lowest denominator type of fast food - the type for being  fat fucks, drunken and stoned. That is the only time I've ever gotten any sort of satisfaction from White Castle is a late night binge with friends who raided the supermarket frozen aisle, Taco Bell and Jack in the Box for some mad munchies marathoning while being too inebriated on drink, herb and food to move from their chair. Being completely sober, drug free and  hungry after a long shift at work, my actual senses and judgement was yelling """"WTF....how is this worth a long line?"""" as I took bites from my sliders. I left a bit salty that I wasted my calories on that. These are the type of famous places that is the reason foreign friends think America is  gross when they try it, just by going by brand hype. I normally don't write pretentious fuck type reviews, but  I definitely agree our American fast food enfatuation is the worst."""	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	1	2015-04-07	6	5

However, if you come here to try a typically East Coast only chain that serves small greasy little burgers that spawned a Stoner movie, then you won't be disappointed. This place is inside a casino but has about 10 tables, is stylized like the East coast locations, and has an assembly crew to handle the giant lines.  Expect about a 20-30 minute wait when you go to order.I love these little burgers, they are the size of a post-it note and about 2 inches tall. Each one is served in a small cardboard box. I like the original without cheese (its just a greasy bun, onions, and patty), the wife likes the ones with cheese.  We pick up 15-20 when we are in the mood for them and these hit the spot from this location.These will not stack up against """"premium burger"""" joints, they are not a premium burger.  This is your 2 am burger where you got a hangover and you need grease.  This is what you get, greasy, greasy goodness. If you want great beef flavor, go to one of the million other burger joints on the strip.If you order any of the sides beware, they are all mediocre. Imagine going to a Burger King and ordering fried chicken... Are you really surprised that it sucks? If you go to White Castle, just get the burgers, skip the rest. If you get the rest, that is on you...The price is a little more than the locations on the East Coast but when everyone else is price gauging on the strip, you can't blame White Castle for doing the same... Worth a try if you have never had it, but do yourself a favor, drink a yard long margarita with a few extra shots first.

Also, what was Harold thinking?Before I go on a rant let's try to find the positives and try to write an unbiased review minus any hype. First off all the servers were incredibly friendly. The menu was easy to read basically pick a number between 1 and 100 to determine how many mini boxes you will get. Everything on the menu is colorful and photogenic. Cliff notes Summary:1. Equal or lesser quality to the frozen store brand2. If your mind is telling you no but your stomach says yes. Ignore that urge to go.3. Taste like a half star better version of McDonald's but someone cut your burger in a square and gives smaller ingredients. 4. When I was done eating my friends first reaction was Can we go now? While my reaction was can I eat somewhere else as a do over for this meal. 5. Sad face. Warning Rant ahead...The HYPE. First to address the hype before the review. I'm sure 99.9% of the people walking in the door watched Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle. I even heard a rumor that a White Castle would be open in Hollywood to promote the movie. False. The closest White Castle to CA at that time was in Chicago but eventually a location came to Las Vegas. The only promise of enjoying a small slider in the frozen form after getting the munchies from a mind altering substance legal in some states was the only way for some people to get a taste. The idea of a fresh burger drew all of us here.Where is the line?... I freaked out thinking... I hope this place isn't packed during lunchtime on a Friday. There was no line just 1 person taking their time ordering and other employees taking their time filling the order. The food is served in little boxes. My first temptation was to order a lot but I calm myself down and decided to start with the 4 sliders combo (2 cheese, 2 plain and fries). Visually, when I received the items it was disappointing compared to the colorful menu pictures. The slider fills about 2/3 of the box (with a 70% bun to meat ratio) and the rest is just air and paper. If only the boxes were etible I would have more food... think a kids happy meal only smaller. The ingredients mimic McDonald's. The pickle, cheese, mustard, onions etc without lettuce or tomato. Only the slider patty is seasoned differently and the bread is like a 99 cent store roll. I can see the appeal of eating 30 boxes... I mean sliders but I rather have a 1 pound burger. Also, sliders are served everywhere in standard bar food and even Dennys is a lot better. I sure there is a disclaimer that reads only consume with alcohol and or other possibly illegal subtances.In California, I am spoiled with the burger options and no In N out is not amazing it's the Honda Civic of burgers there good and reliable but there are better  options.  It's a good thing this place is Las Vegas. I can't speak for the rest of the country but if this is your only option I can understand the love for White Castle but if you've tried other options you will be sadly disappointed. If you want a burger you can hold in 2 hands this is not the place. The location is not easily accessible since it faces The Strip. If you are not walking around this general area it is a bit of a walk. I don't recommend going as a fast food option on your last day when leaving  Las Vegas. I parked at Venetian and walked past so many great affordable eating places on the way to White Castle. I feel like an idiot now, after the disappointment of my lunch choice. In conclusion, just don't do it. My mistake was I had Shake Shack the day before and I ignored my brain that warned me about the hype. Fool me once shame on me but fool my twice F U. If you are a fan do whatever floats your boat but if you are trying for the first time just don't go. There is very little room left for improvement. White Castle is for people that enjoy McDonald's but want a smaller snack with food that taste like it came from the frozen section of a grocery store.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	2	2016-12-09	1	1

That movie came out a while back so I pretty much had forgotten about it. I was at the Mirage watching the volcano erupt at 8pm. I turned around and there it was, the bright sign was shining in my face. It was calling out to me, I had to go. They have no White Castle in Hawaii where I'm from.We had just eaten at a buffet but I had to try this place out. I just got a cheese slider. My hubby got the chicken ring slider combo, which came with fries and a drink. I know that their sliders are small, but it must have shrunk some more because it was tiny. The hamburger patty was paper thin but it was tasty. They serve crinkle cut fries and not shoestring. At least the fries were crispy and not soggy. The wait time for our three sliders and fries was 20 minutes. I guess this must be a popular place on the mainland.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	3	2015-11-02	8	5

This was unexpected and amazing! We were just walking down the strip and ran into a White Castle! I thought I was dreaming!! Sooooooo good!!!	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	5	2015-09-19	0	0

The employees are very friendly and the food comes out very fast.  It is located next to Walgreens on the strip and the restaurant itself is a bit dirty and ghetto but you shouldn't expect that much at a fast food joint.  This was my very first time having white castle (never had the frozen ones before either).  I must say I am happy I waited to try it here than settle for just trying the frozen versions.  I like being special like that haha	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	4	2015-12-05	12	9

Especially after Harold & Kumar took a wonderful journey just to go to one of these White Castles.Let's get down and dirty. In & Out still reigns supreme for fast food burger joints. It beats this by miles! It also beats the East Coast's Shake Shack if you look at it as a whole in terms of value/quality etc. Where Shake Shack actually serves up good quality food, despite a higher price than In & Out (In & Out serves good quality food at a great price--thus why it's hard to beat), White Castle on the other hand tastes as good as it looks--and go look at the pictures.The burgers are tiny, and thus why they serve them in multiples when you order a combo. Usually 4 or 6 etc. They are served in those signature boxes. We just got the cheeseburgers for our first time experience. The food is a BIG BIG """"MEHHHH"""". Nothing special at all. Like I said, taste as good as it looks, and it's not much to look at. This location is located inside the Casino Royale. It has it's own entrance from outside the strip, but it is not an isolated space of it's own. Once you go inside you will see the casino floor on the right. So if you were hoping to not be exposed to smoke, think again. The staff all seemed great though, despite being hectic opening week.I'm just glad I got it out of the way and was able to say I've tried it."""	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	2	2015-02-02	2	1

He waited in line at Foodie Fest and always makes a stop when he goes back home to Chicago.  So when Vegas got a WC we had to check it out.  Got sliders, fries and chicken rings.  Line wasn't to bad, it was a evening midweek.  I thought everything was OK.  Nothing special but not gross by any means.  Sliders tasted the same as the frozen ones to me.  I wish they had the full menu but maybe that will come in time.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	3	2015-03-22	1	2

I'd say try out simply to say you had White Castle. For $10 you do get full and their onion chips are pretty good, but other than that know that they are mini sliders (and sliders are already small). I guess 4 mini sliders equals an average size burger. I would suggest though when in a group of four get the 10 sliders special and split should get you through and save money when looking to be resourceful with your expenses in Vegas.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	2	2016-05-13	0	0

I love the cheese sliders and for the first time we were able to try the breakfast menu. Amazing. I wish they served it all day. Great prices and the best fast food.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	5	2016-08-08	0	0
1	UzcvzQlG7jsVGIsI4H7cIg	kX8TsHw6YlY74m8hDPCuyQ	I was extremely excited when I found out White Castle came to vegas. I remember eating those ones you get in the freezer section at the grocery store. The burgers at White Castle taste exactly like the ones in the frozen section. I am very disappointed. First of all, every worker here looks miserable. Does anybody know how to smile? Say thank you? Don't you work in customer service? I've worked in food and beverage and customer service for a long time and I know that your job can be stressful or whatever but at least look up at me and look like you care. I feel this place could benefit from the manager monitoring everyone. Anyway,I order original cheese sliders and jalapeño cheese sliders. I am awaiting for my number to be called then loudly and obnoxiously on the intercom I hear mine. I'm pretty excited still. I go up to get my food and then ask for ketchup. The lady goes to grab ketchup and hands it to me without saying anything. Then I ask for ranch. She looks irritated and then goes and grabs me ranch. I also asked for mayo then she finally looked up at me, kind of rolled her eyes, grabs that even more frustrated and hands it over. She never said one word to me.The burgers... were okay. I open the bun and the cheese is not melted. In some of them they were partially melted. But man.. at least throw it in the toaster oven or microwave or something. I hate cold cheese. It doesn't look like I'll be coming back. I can just go to the store, buy the freezer ones and warm those up.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	3	2016-04-23	1	1

The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the line is too long and they should come up with  a better way to meet customers' needs or open another location in Vegas!	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	4	2016-09-11	0	0
1	hqSXx-zbBvnWW7akjPhZNg	jREfd7FglMqBLOPGyzdXYA	Finally after 10+ years of being near a White Castle in Ohio and never getting to go... I made it!I was good and got on Cheese Burger and it was delish! My friend compared it to McDonald's. I like McDonald's and I can definitely taste the difference. I can say if this place was closer to me I would want to try everything!The best time to come here would be during the day, forget about coming here at 2 in the morning, the line was insane!	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	4	2016-07-26	1	1

1	fgnccvVwJi-_BCYye_HRpQ	f8QIpi8eKyoVKhGrQkRbew	"""Years and years ago, I remember my cousins and I dined at a White Castle in New Jersey. We ordered an entire Crave Case. We ate the entire case! I can't imagine ever doing that now. This was the first time I had White Castle since then. I was severely disappointed and it's not because I went with the veggie burger this time. Everything was disgusting. It was a poor excuse for what they are calling a """"burger"""" and """"fries"""". Their onion fries were their saving grace. It was the best thing we ordered, which was at least edible. My girlfriends had the burger and neither of them finished their meals. Our order took forever because I ordered the veggie. Apparently it takes longer to make? Perhaps it's because it isn't ordered as much as the burgers? For the 3 of us, we spent a total of $17 which included a beer. This is definitely a cheap eat, and somewhere you'd go if you were drunk and hungry. There's no other reason why you'd """"crave"""" this place ever. Save your money and calories and get a real burger from Shake Shack or In n Out Burger."""	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	1	2016-09-09	0	1
