We went in an ordered are whole meal and they did not except are gift card, because their system was down. Unacceptable, this would have been so helpful if we would have known this prior!!	jQsNFOzDpxPmOurSWCg1vQ	1	2017-06-03	0	0

I had the Asian chicken salad and was impressed! There was a decent amount of chicken. Some more veggies would be nice, but overall pretty good. The steak teriyaki was great as well as the fried rice. Over all good was good! Nice, clean, and reasonable."""	jQsNFOzDpxPmOurSWCg1vQ	4	2015-03-26	1	0

I cam and my food was ready for me. Driving home the smell in my car was so good I could barely wait to get home and try it - true umami!I got home and dug into the delicious spicy chicken and rice with sugar snapies and carrots. It was superb! For $9 I will definitely try this again! I did see a huge line at the store, so try doing an online order and pickup forsure!p.s. they even include GF soy sauce!	jQsNFOzDpxPmOurSWCg1vQ	5	2012-12-30	2	1

The manager apologized and asked me If I would like to come back to the restaurant or if he could have my address so he could send me a gift certificate. I decided to go back to the restaurant, when I got the restaurant I told the person at the counter my name and they already had a bag set aside for me, the manager came over and explained to me there was another full salad in the bag, and he put additional dressing for the salad we already had, and additionally he gave me a coupon for free lettuce wraps.(which mental note: I need to use)I must say I was impressed with this manager, and it was refreshing after being in situations where a manager has taken back the bag/plate and essentially """"un-F$@k's"""" your food and returns it to you.Overall great customer service, consistent food, and a good option for takeout in surprise."""	jQsNFOzDpxPmOurSWCg1vQ	3	2009-01-12	1	1

Very basic decor, but clean and fast seating.  Lettuce Wraps just as good as Chang's.  Very busy, especially the take out.  Glad to have it close	jQsNFOzDpxPmOurSWCg1vQ	4	2010-04-05	0	0
0	P8mVj7AZwJTFFH5FXbbmUg	oiSzZRrbi3y01_wqU528ZQ	The staff here is great and they're nice,  wonderful and quick. People were ranting in raving about pei wei, I had to try it.  Even good yelp reviews.  I'm highly dissatisfied with the flavor of the food. This  should be labeled Asian inspired and not Asian. I've tried a variety of Chinese restaurants, this doesn't taste close to anything I've had at other Asian restaurants. Their Mongolian beef  was 5 pieces of beef and large mushrooms cut into thirds in a thick sauce. You eat the rice to wash off the nasty flavor. My shrimp was thickly coated in an overpowering  sauce as well.  I only ate some of the veggies that take center stage on a meat dish.  The center of my pork egg roll was cold. The hot N sour soup was a much thicker consistency almost like that of a chili instead of being brothy. Worst of all was the price.  This was not worth it to us. Neither me or my husband enjoyed either of  our dishes.  We didn't even eat half of our plates.  We even refused to take it home with us.  If you like and enjoy what typical Asian food tastes like,  don't waste your time here.	jQsNFOzDpxPmOurSWCg1vQ	1	2015-05-22	0	0

Everything else was great. I will give them a few more tries before I write them off as another crappy Asian restaurant in Surprise.	jQsNFOzDpxPmOurSWCg1vQ	2	2011-06-15	1	0
0	vgZqQqe8cj6SBMH0EqDliw	kznHtw1Qido_9GX6sDQPJw	This review is based upon consistency of flavor and great customer service.  We came and there was an unknown issue that required a 25 minute wait for food.  The employee notified us, and although hesitant, we decided to stay.  We have been here numerous times before in the past years so we are familiar with this location.  The employee was apologetic and gave us a free drink.  That was a simple gesture but rarely do you see decent customer service anymore.  We received our food and had an issue with an incorrect order.  It was explained and the issue was resolved quickly.  They gave us a free appetizer.  We do not expect perfection, nor free food.  This restaurant cares for customers and works to provide a positive experience.  We would return again because they have good food and they care.  That is a rarity in today's restaurant culture.  Kudos to the manager for creating this culture.  Ordered- fried rive and Tofu, edamame, won ton soup, dynamite chx, and Thai curry chx	jQsNFOzDpxPmOurSWCg1vQ	5	2017-03-12	0	0

0	1YorWW0Z-YDuYC5GplNabw	OrhWg2MmCznwfKfjHKvuhA	Pretty good, not great. Definitely overpriced. It's barely a step up from Panda and not worth the price difference.

Waiting in the car to pick up a large order makes me think twice about catering from here.

Kinda like a fast food place.... you walk up and order then get your own drinks etc. Portions are very small.

2	PKZLwAGgBtQCjJtGhyPETA	ukpjwnetF5wGhGrSXmPRwA	I love Pei Wei since it's just a bit more affordable than PF Changs.This is the first restaurant in the chain where I found patrons tipping the servers. Although I don't mind leaving a dollar when it's due I find it hard to do when they don't do very much, especially since it's more of a counter service experience.	jQsNFOzDpxPmOurSWCg1vQ	4	2012-07-29	1	2

This is a sister restaurant to PF Chang's, but without the formality or higher prices. Great place to eat if you want the same style foods as PF Chang's, but a more laid back environment without the need to dress up or spend more.	jQsNFOzDpxPmOurSWCg1vQ	4	2016-06-19	1	0

Overall, if I'm really in the mood for chinese food I'm going to make the drive a little further out to Big Buddha on Greenway and the 303, but this is a good substitute as it's about 1 minute from my house.	jQsNFOzDpxPmOurSWCg1vQ	3	2012-08-23	0	0

I love being able to just say """"same as last time"""" when I call it in. Not as good as PF Changs, but certainly better than most other Asian-ish places in Surprise. Be aware that they use shitake mushrooms is almost everything, but they are fine with custom orders if you don't want them. All in all, it's not my favorite place, but I always enjoy it every time."""	jQsNFOzDpxPmOurSWCg1vQ	4	2009-06-25	2	1

The hubs ordered Mongolian Beef (his fav at PF Chang's) and I ordered my """"tried and true"""" Ginger Broccoli and Chicken."""" Of course we started with the Lettuce Wraps because honestly...they are just the most delicious things ever!Tonight we were pleasantly suprised that the food was quite delicious. Although the dishes are EXACTLY like what you would get at PF Chang's they are scrumptous in their own right. The only downfall is that the noise isn't conducive to conversation.  I haven't been to an establishment this noisy since Buca de Beppo's...which I love (don't get me wrong)!  But I will say (on a positive note) that the customer service is fabulous! Something that can be hard to come by at times...As for price....$28 bucks for the two of us including an appetizer, two entrees and two drinks. (coke and iced tea...with free refills) Seems a bit pricy to me but honestly....EVERYTHING is expensive now days. Overall, try it out...they offer take out too so you can enjoy great food in the comfort of your home....without all the noise!

We were served quickly and the staff was friendly! The restaurant was clean and tables were bussed quickly. I was disappointed with my Mongolian chicken. It tasted more like Teriyaki and was swimming in sauce. I had at least a 1/3 cup of sauce left on my plate after eating my food.All in all, PeiWei's food will be why I don't return anytime soon even though their staff was excellent and so was the atmosphere.	jQsNFOzDpxPmOurSWCg1vQ	2	2014-10-01	0	0

0	R-kL1bocHgP4GW7Mgd-ZXA	nI2rhDM2CgNazMdhiODoRQ	OH MY GOD, this place. I used to like Pei Wei until I moved to Surprise and this location ruined it for me. They consistently screw up on orders, have huge wait times, and run out of key ingredients on an alarmingly regular basis. We just spent an hour waiting for a take out order (kung pao veggies and vegetable fried rice), which was twice the time they quoted us, only to be told they were out of WHITE RICE (how does a chinese restaurant fail to foresee the possibility that they might serve a lot of white rice on a Saturday night?!). I may have chosen to stick around the extra 15 minutes if they hadn't already had to re-make half my order after making it incorrectly the first time. When I change up an order even slightly to accommodate for allergies/dietary needs, they have to re-make it at least 75% of the time.If the food was consistently delicious, I'd rate it higher, but honestly, it's only okay.	jQsNFOzDpxPmOurSWCg1vQ	2	2016-02-14	0	0
5	6jz_Yr6_AP2WWLbj9gGDpA	sb7iYaCc6ggpShtElkcwiw	My wife wanted to try this place for awhile now.  One of her brothers friends used to be a manager of one in Colorado too.  Tonight we decided to try it out.I placed my order online.  Easy process.  My wife went with an order of Chicken Lo Mein and I went with Sesame Chicken/Steak with fried rice as well as an egg roll and 2 pot stickers.  Total for everything was $24.80 after tax.  I drove down and picked up my food.  The manager their was friendly, rang me up real quick and I was out the door in no time. This bag was heavy as hell too!   Here is how everything tasted.....................Chicken Lo Mein-  Only had a little of this.  Good noodles, good white meat chicken.  My wife liked it.Sesame Chicken/Steak-  I decided to try out 2 kinds of meat.  They let you mix and match which is cool...they charge you for the highest priced item.  I substituted fried rice for white rice (.99 cents extra).  This was touted as soy citrus glaze, red bell peppers, onions, scallions, ginger, garlic and chile paste and sesame seeds.  It was just alright.  The flavors didn't really do much for me.  It was a tad spicy from the chile paste but overall it was kind of bland.  I had some pieces of steak/chicken that were a bit funky too.  I would definitely try out a different dish next time here...if there is a next time ;-).  The fried rice was good!Egg Roll- Eh.  It was an egg roll.  Nothing fantastic about it but it tasted fine.  It came with a sweet mustard dipping sauce which was pretty tasty.  Usual fillings of pork, veggies etc.Deep Fried Pot Stickers-  I got 2 of these things.  They were good.  Small but good.  Straight pork filling in the middle of them.  Overall it was just alright.  I will say that they give you a GRIP of food.  The 2 entrees we got could have easily fed 1-2 more people.  For $24.80 it was a great value.  The food just wasn't the type of thing that  you would ever crave and keep you coming back though.  While I was eating my meal, all I could think of were better Chinese food places I have had before....wishing I was eating them instead.  It filled my belly, service was friendly and the value is definitely there.  I'll probably give them another try and order some other dishes to see if there is something I really like.  We shall see............	jQsNFOzDpxPmOurSWCg1vQ	3	2015-02-12	7	6

(we didn't know it was a like share the bowl type of place, and when we figured it out we didn't do it because hers had meat). But overall this place was amazing. The employees are very very nice!

The food was greasy (I guess most Americans would love it since they don't see the difference) The manager had the audacity to compare this restaurant with PF Chang which is equally greasy and bad. I wouldn't recommend this place to any health conscious people. To top it all its expensive. Go to taco bell or China Panda and save your frustration and your appetite.

Sorry to say we were quite disappointed with our Pad Thai orders today, so much sauce that it resembled a thick soup.  The egg ingredient seemed to be overlooked and was in big slices rather than smaller curds,  when I asked a server about the sauce he replied that it wasn't really sauce but that the rice noodles were too wet.  Either way, it was not a pleasant dish today.	jQsNFOzDpxPmOurSWCg1vQ	2	2015-01-21	2	1

Sometimes they tell me they never even received my order when I received the confirmation email. Also, if you in during a busy time and have a teenage girl as a cashier, you're chances of having a pleasant experience with her are slim to none. This has happened to me multiple times with multiple different cashiers. I have spoken to the manager and he is always very apologetic, but I guess you just can't get stressed teenage girls to be nice to customers. I will continue to go here as the food is good for the price and they are relatively quick with preparation. Nice options if you're veggies as well.	jQsNFOzDpxPmOurSWCg1vQ	4	2016-02-13	0	0

Take out rocks, call ahead.  They remember your phone number and name, so when you call they already know you.  They also save your last order to ask if you want the same, or to add anything to it... Nice touch.  I think I eat there too much! The only thing I don't like, and I think I'm the only one who doesn't like it, is the soda machine.  Only because I always get a soda after someone has pumped out some nasty combination of orange soda and root beer, then I can taste it in my coke.  Wish they had some filter system.  Otherwise, I could eat here daily.  Find me here at least once a week! :)	jQsNFOzDpxPmOurSWCg1vQ	5	2012-07-08	2	1

The Mongolian beef was delicious, however the white rice was undercooked, some of the rice was hard still and crunchy.Honey crusted chicken also quite good, same story with the rice.  Same thing with the sweet and sour beef.Ordered the Pad Thai without peanuts... Son is allergic to peanuts so we made it very clear we didn't want anything with nuts.  They deliver the pad Thai with peanuts all over the top.  Sent it back and they fixed it.They brought us spring rolls which we did not order.  We said they were not ours we ordered wontons.  They bring us the wontons a few minutes later.  The wontons are less expensive than the spring rolls, we point that our to the guy at the register and with a bit of smart-alecky-ness says that he """"let us keep the spring rolls"""" and """"didn't charge is for all of our drinks"""" as if he did us a favor.Overall the food was decent, the rice was terrible and the attitude of the cashier was not what I expected with a $65 food order!!I wouldn't go back for that price and food quality but perhaps we caught them on a bad day.."""	jQsNFOzDpxPmOurSWCg1vQ	2	2013-05-23	0	0

I really wish there was an awesome offering out there in terms of Chinese food.. Mexican food, oh yeah, some very good places mostly but Asian, youre better off staying at home and cooking. We ordered the Asian Chicken Salad, chicken was old and had that old gross fridge taste.. Dan Dan Noodle, the noodles were over cooked and stuck together as one large soggy noodle.. Curry with Tofu, the curry had a weird perfume taste.. the honey chicken was pretty good as well as the hot and sour soup though neither made for good leftovers. With Surprise having so many chains it wasnt surprising to see one of these finally opening up.. a far better choice than Panda Express.. kind of sad, huh?	jQsNFOzDpxPmOurSWCg1vQ	2	2008-11-27	8	6

Let me just say that, a man named Paul Fleming (PF) and (Flemings) is responsible for many of the restaurants that you and I frequent. His ex wife and him went through a bitter divorce her nickname is (Flow) and she operates """"Flows,"""" Chinese restaurants. Flow is Chinese and married another Caucasian man 20-25 years younger than her, who speaks fluent Chinese. Anyways, Peiwei's in my opinion is overpriced for the small amount of you receive for the consideration you give. In other words, there's no value for your consideration. Yes, I do enjoy the PeiWei Spicy chicken, extra spicy with water chestnuts, but at $12.53 for the water chestnuts and extra chicken, it's just not worth it. The rice is almost always dry and is cooked incorrectly in massive amounts, as well as being a long grain, not short grain rice. NOT WORTH THE MONEY!!!"""	jQsNFOzDpxPmOurSWCg1vQ	3	2017-06-10	5	3

The crab wontons are usually a sure bet at any Asian restaurant but for some reason it just always sucks ass here. Fishy weird taste that's contrary to what they should taste like and the sauce is garbage. Teriyaki Chicken was bland and shitty. Pei Wei Spicy dish was average at best only cuz of the sweet sugary sauce that masks the overall flavor. Now my girlfriend and I just feel like shit.. Why? Cuz it's shitty food. Also saw on the local news that the location on Glendale and 7th st. had 4 health code violations. I'm officially done with this place.

First I was unable to order online,   when I  went to pick up the food I brought  a gift card with a remaining credit on it and the remaining total written on top with a permanent marker which would have covered the entire cost of my meal. When I handed it over to the employee  she swiped the card and simply stated there is a zero balance on this card. To which I replied that can't be correct because the last time I used it the employee wrote the available balance on the top of the card for me. The cashier didn't seem to take me serious and simply asked for another method of payment. I was in a rush it was my lunch hour so  I paid out of pocket. The sauce on my food taste watered down over all a poor experience. To add insult to injury I later called the number on my gift card and they assured me that I did have a credit balance which leave's me wondering what are gift card's good for?

I couldn't believe it; it took them a long time to have my order ready but still manage to not cook it all the way.  I didn't realize it was frozen until I got back to work to eat it.  By then, I didn't have time to return to have them make me a new one.This is an expensive place for just sandwiches only.  My Panini alone was over $8 after tax.  Not a good value because it doesn't even come with a drink or side.  I appreciate and support local businesses whenever possible but after this mishap, I won't be back.	_mqUzNXs_sJ1EJYgYZYszg	1	2017-04-13	0	0

Hot tasty coffee. friendly staff. Outdoor seating option.All for under $6.So glad I didn't have the more expensive breakfast in my corporate airport hotel.	_mqUzNXs_sJ1EJYgYZYszg	5	2015-12-08	0	0
0	7a2OVx6IJTMpUtYDLPZhwA	Xd7fDGNp6wc_8mjPs0Unvw	I stumbled upon the Lunch Lounge while staying at the Aloft last week, and was thrilled that I did. It's kind of hidden from the street behind the Radisson on 44th St, but that didn't stop me from taking the short walk over from the hotel. Cute little place with great service and good eats! They have all kinds of sandwiches and salads, and couldn't decide what I wanted since the menu looked so good. They serve Boar's Head meats, which makes for an awesome sandwich. My friends who were staying with me raved about the food and said they wanted to come here for lunch again tomorrow. Only not so great thing was that they were out of the soup of the day, which we wanted to try, but since we did come about a half hour before they closed I could live with that. Wish we had more deli-type places like this in Milwaukee! Yummmmm!	_mqUzNXs_sJ1EJYgYZYszg	4	2014-11-22	0	1
1	bCj_W-14a7SmGKyYufPzZg	18RML0hSOiL4oWSpHefNfA	What a find!  While staying at the Aloft in Phoenix for business we found this on a morning walk.   We had the breakfast burrito and a breakfast panini.  Both were excellent!  The burrito was so large we agreed that it could have fed us both.The lunch menu looked great and I would like to try some of the sandwiches.We are here for a few more days and will eat here on Monday.If you are staying at a hotel in this area be sure to give it a try for a good quick breakfast or lunch.  You won't be disappointed.	_mqUzNXs_sJ1EJYgYZYszg	5	2013-04-05	1	0

Fresh vegetables and Boar's head meat. Warning if you order a cold sub sandwich the bread is a bit too much.  It's loaded with goodies but it's too much bread.	_mqUzNXs_sJ1EJYgYZYszg	4	2016-02-19	0	0
0	k-p5RfLnAPEherauN4CxUQ	gKMHY8pY2yLELjYqqa57ng	Great breakfast panini for $5. More affordable than a breakfast or brunch chain for sure. Nothing for breakfast is over $5 which makes this a spot I will recommend and more than likely come back to next trip. Iced coffee is only $1 till 11 and breakfast is served til 11.	_mqUzNXs_sJ1EJYgYZYszg	4	2016-07-07	1	0

The Italian sub was loaded with meat - just like back home (Boston) - salad was fresh, bread was fresh, meat was just YUMMY!! Nice surprise - we will all be back. BTW - lunch for 4 + drinks was $30.00 ... Great, clean, fresh and friendly!!	_mqUzNXs_sJ1EJYgYZYszg	5	2015-12-20	0	0

0	CQ7tEwDL_5jpEJzDKKYv4Q	RH2Hzv7_erHGpDlXMvYWdw	Restaurant/Ambiance: Small cafe tucked away in a corporate office park. Has a Modern but relaxed cafe vibe inside. Has about 12 or so tables inside with 3 tables outside. Typical clients are business execs and tradespeople on lunch break. No issue getting a table or parking space. Little difficult to find though.Food: Great selection of sandwiches. Quality meats and fresh veggies. I like the southwest chicken chipotle sandwich. Also excellent salad menu. They also have a great breakfast menu but I've never been there for breakfast.Service: Fast service, able to move the lunch rush pretty well.Overall: Great little lunch cafe!	_mqUzNXs_sJ1EJYgYZYszg	4	2016-08-04	1	0

I have worked across the street for 15 years and I am so thrilled to finally have good food in the area.  The Chicken Fiesta Wrap is my favorite (I CRAVE it) and the California Club is really good too (crispy bacon....yummmm). If you can get there before they run out of Tortilla Soup it is outstanding. The food is always consistent and they don't seem to cut corners. Reasonably priced for what you get and what's in the area. Fast service, wifi on site, nice staff...I seriously cannot say anything negative.  Thank you for saving our lunch dilemma in the area!	_mqUzNXs_sJ1EJYgYZYszg	5	2016-03-10	0	0

It's in the back of a building that blends in with the rest.I had a Cobb salad and it was fresh and ready in about 3 minutes. Seemed like good friendly sevice.

0	sOCuf-jZo43DUzWTDKiR9w	A6vxSSNe2x2c_kdHtvF7hA	Great little sandwich shop tucked into the office plaza (Follow the sandwich board signs to find it). I had the lunch roast beef special and it was really good. The red potato salad seemed to be missing something for my palate, but over all it was really good! Meat was tender, taste was good and no overpowering sauces. Its a bit cramped in there so a togo order is a good idea, but its close to my other office so it makes for a perfect stop. Service was fast considering the crowd at lunch and the patrons and employees seemed to know one another.Its a nice place if you are in the area, stop by and have lunch!	_mqUzNXs_sJ1EJYgYZYszg	3	2015-07-31	0	0

(: The set up is nice with an option to eat indoors/outdoors although I wouldn't recommend bringing large parties. Customer service was good and the food was delicious! I had to go with the BLT which, they did not shy away with the bacon. I wouldn't mind visiting back for lunch again.	_mqUzNXs_sJ1EJYgYZYszg	4	2017-05-14	0	0
0	ktdSILM4nVCPAzVVVQmB_w	XcARF3jBueZcmXNyfr6gNQ	I feel like this place has gotten worse over time, and it feels as every time I try to go back, they fail to meet the mark somehow. I used to frequent it when my work first moved into this area, about 4 years ago, but I think today was the draw for me. They forgot to include dressing with my $9 salad. Also, without the dressing, the chicken has a strange taste, almost questionable, which makes me wonder how it has tasted in the past...at least I got extra spinach. The initial reason I started going here less often was a noticeable decrease in their salad sizes a few years back, hence I ask for extra spinach. One good thing they have going for themselves is that the veggies they use in their salads always taste fresh, for that reason I gave them two starts instead of one. However, I expect better for the price they ask for their food. Today was my last visit and I will make sure to spread the word at work.	_mqUzNXs_sJ1EJYgYZYszg	2	2017-01-10	0	0

0	oBQL575GZLzElgQg7wrq9Q	LIFGdvp1ftt7FSknVReeGg	Was in Phoenix for business and discovered this friendly, wonderful  haunt  near the airport.  I had the best lunch ever -  a Southwestern chicken chipotle panini.  OMG!  The guy behind the counter turned out to be the owner, and himself grew up in a family owned East coast deli.  I had several expensive meals during my trip, but nothing was as tasty as my Lunch Lounge experience!  I made sure I had time for a breakfast stop on my way back to the airport., and was again wowed with a huge breakfast burrito, great latte and a smile - all for less than my daily NYC latte and muffin.  My  client has never been to The Lunch Lounge, so next time I am in town, we have a lunch date at the best undiscovered charming cafe in Phoenix!  I can't wait to share the secret!	_mqUzNXs_sJ1EJYgYZYszg	5	2013-11-04	0	0

0	e0TeYGOQRM2PrYCAdho7lg	eizIAeDy6K9bVFqjQ_j9mg	"""I visited this restaurant because I got a groupon now deal. When I walked In and the older woman standing there took about 5 minutes to acknowledge that I was standing there at the counter waiting to be served..Finally she said """"whenever your ready.."""". I told her hi how are you, giving her a nice reminder that that is how your supposed to greet new customers in your establishment. That on its own turned me off because I hate giving my money away tobusinesses that don't appreciate me.  I don't feel like I am asking for much in exchange for coming back and supporting local businesses. As I was standing waiting for my food I overheard the employees (including my o so pleasnt serve lady) complaining about the groupons that kept coming in.. while I was standing there! Rude! The older man behind the counter making sandwiches was very nice. He is the only reason I am giving two stars. The food on the other hand was decent. Too bad I won't ever becoming back just to be treated like I am bothering them.. next time I will just eat mcdonalds breakfast like I wanted anyways."""	_mqUzNXs_sJ1EJYgYZYszg	2	2013-06-20	1	1

I had the Thanksgiving lunch special - turkey, stuffing, cranberry jam, and I held off on the cheese. Nicely toasted bread - all in all, a decent lunch!	_mqUzNXs_sJ1EJYgYZYszg	3	2012-10-21	1	2

They pulled the burrito out of the microwave so I assume that's how they cook it. I'd recommend checking something else out next time.	_mqUzNXs_sJ1EJYgYZYszg	3	2017-06-26	0	0

This place is just across the street from where I work and everyone is blown away by the food. The staff is super friendly and the food is really fresh. The owner took my order a few weeks back and recommended the Stromboli since I always ordered the Roast Beef Press (which is fantastic!). O. M. G... the Stromboli is the best sandwich I've ever had. Inside out sub roll, pesto, ham, pepperoni, salami, cheese, and cherry peppers - toasted on a panini press. Seriously? On my day off from work, I drove 30 minutes back there to take family there for lunch. If they served dinner, I'd have to think about moving closer.	_mqUzNXs_sJ1EJYgYZYszg	5	2015-01-28	0	0

I tried the Southwest Chipotle Chicken Panini and my co-worker had the Hot Roast Beef Press.  Both were good choices, but seeing how happy she was with her choice I have to come back to try that one next.  Plenty of off-street parking.  I only wish this place was open on weekends (although given their location I can understand why they are not).  Maybe open a second location near the business park at University and Elwood (hint, hint)?  I'm pretty sure it would be a big hit.	_mqUzNXs_sJ1EJYgYZYszg	4	2014-08-15	0	0

Was able to find something for all of us. Pb&j's for the kids and a hot pastrami for me. Both were delicious and the staff was friendly. Quick, easy and much healthier than the fast food chains.

Whether it is breakfast or lunch you can't go wrong with trying this place for a simple, but gourmet, breakfast sandwich or a dressed up salad for lunch. I only gave them four stars for this type of venue because I felt they were a bit understaffed when I arrived around 10am. Don't hold this against them. It was a bit of a wait for a sandwich but the quality is well worth the wait. The dill on the breakfast sandwich was a nice touch. The outdoor seating was nice on a cool morning.	_mqUzNXs_sJ1EJYgYZYszg	4	2014-03-25	2	0
