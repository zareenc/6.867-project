We went in an ordered are whole meal and they did not except are gift card, because their system was down. Unacceptable, this would have been so helpful if we would have known this prior!!	jQsNFOzDpxPmOurSWCg1vQ	1	2017-06-03	0	0

I had the Asian chicken salad and was impressed! There was a decent amount of chicken. Some more veggies would be nice, but overall pretty good. The steak teriyaki was great as well as the fried rice. Over all good was good! Nice, clean, and reasonable."""	jQsNFOzDpxPmOurSWCg1vQ	4	2015-03-26	1	0

I cam and my food was ready for me. Driving home the smell in my car was so good I could barely wait to get home and try it - true umami!I got home and dug into the delicious spicy chicken and rice with sugar snapies and carrots. It was superb! For $9 I will definitely try this again! I did see a huge line at the store, so try doing an online order and pickup forsure!p.s. they even include GF soy sauce!	jQsNFOzDpxPmOurSWCg1vQ	5	2012-12-30	2	1

The manager apologized and asked me If I would like to come back to the restaurant or if he could have my address so he could send me a gift certificate. I decided to go back to the restaurant, when I got the restaurant I told the person at the counter my name and they already had a bag set aside for me, the manager came over and explained to me there was another full salad in the bag, and he put additional dressing for the salad we already had, and additionally he gave me a coupon for free lettuce wraps.(which mental note: I need to use)I must say I was impressed with this manager, and it was refreshing after being in situations where a manager has taken back the bag/plate and essentially """"un-F$@k's"""" your food and returns it to you.Overall great customer service, consistent food, and a good option for takeout in surprise."""	jQsNFOzDpxPmOurSWCg1vQ	3	2009-01-12	1	1

Very basic decor, but clean and fast seating.  Lettuce Wraps just as good as Chang's.  Very busy, especially the take out.  Glad to have it close	jQsNFOzDpxPmOurSWCg1vQ	4	2010-04-05	0	0
0	P8mVj7AZwJTFFH5FXbbmUg	oiSzZRrbi3y01_wqU528ZQ	The staff here is great and they're nice,  wonderful and quick. People were ranting in raving about pei wei, I had to try it.  Even good yelp reviews.  I'm highly dissatisfied with the flavor of the food. This  should be labeled Asian inspired and not Asian. I've tried a variety of Chinese restaurants, this doesn't taste close to anything I've had at other Asian restaurants. Their Mongolian beef  was 5 pieces of beef and large mushrooms cut into thirds in a thick sauce. You eat the rice to wash off the nasty flavor. My shrimp was thickly coated in an overpowering  sauce as well.  I only ate some of the veggies that take center stage on a meat dish.  The center of my pork egg roll was cold. The hot N sour soup was a much thicker consistency almost like that of a chili instead of being brothy. Worst of all was the price.  This was not worth it to us. Neither me or my husband enjoyed either of  our dishes.  We didn't even eat half of our plates.  We even refused to take it home with us.  If you like and enjoy what typical Asian food tastes like,  don't waste your time here.	jQsNFOzDpxPmOurSWCg1vQ	1	2015-05-22	0	0

Everything else was great. I will give them a few more tries before I write them off as another crappy Asian restaurant in Surprise.	jQsNFOzDpxPmOurSWCg1vQ	2	2011-06-15	1	0
0	vgZqQqe8cj6SBMH0EqDliw	kznHtw1Qido_9GX6sDQPJw	This review is based upon consistency of flavor and great customer service.  We came and there was an unknown issue that required a 25 minute wait for food.  The employee notified us, and although hesitant, we decided to stay.  We have been here numerous times before in the past years so we are familiar with this location.  The employee was apologetic and gave us a free drink.  That was a simple gesture but rarely do you see decent customer service anymore.  We received our food and had an issue with an incorrect order.  It was explained and the issue was resolved quickly.  They gave us a free appetizer.  We do not expect perfection, nor free food.  This restaurant cares for customers and works to provide a positive experience.  We would return again because they have good food and they care.  That is a rarity in today's restaurant culture.  Kudos to the manager for creating this culture.  Ordered- fried rive and Tofu, edamame, won ton soup, dynamite chx, and Thai curry chx	jQsNFOzDpxPmOurSWCg1vQ	5	2017-03-12	0	0

0	1YorWW0Z-YDuYC5GplNabw	OrhWg2MmCznwfKfjHKvuhA	Pretty good, not great. Definitely overpriced. It's barely a step up from Panda and not worth the price difference.

Waiting in the car to pick up a large order makes me think twice about catering from here.

Kinda like a fast food place.... you walk up and order then get your own drinks etc. Portions are very small.

2	PKZLwAGgBtQCjJtGhyPETA	ukpjwnetF5wGhGrSXmPRwA	I love Pei Wei since it's just a bit more affordable than PF Changs.This is the first restaurant in the chain where I found patrons tipping the servers. Although I don't mind leaving a dollar when it's due I find it hard to do when they don't do very much, especially since it's more of a counter service experience.	jQsNFOzDpxPmOurSWCg1vQ	4	2012-07-29	1	2

This is a sister restaurant to PF Chang's, but without the formality or higher prices. Great place to eat if you want the same style foods as PF Chang's, but a more laid back environment without the need to dress up or spend more.	jQsNFOzDpxPmOurSWCg1vQ	4	2016-06-19	1	0

Overall, if I'm really in the mood for chinese food I'm going to make the drive a little further out to Big Buddha on Greenway and the 303, but this is a good substitute as it's about 1 minute from my house.	jQsNFOzDpxPmOurSWCg1vQ	3	2012-08-23	0	0

I love being able to just say """"same as last time"""" when I call it in. Not as good as PF Changs, but certainly better than most other Asian-ish places in Surprise. Be aware that they use shitake mushrooms is almost everything, but they are fine with custom orders if you don't want them. All in all, it's not my favorite place, but I always enjoy it every time."""	jQsNFOzDpxPmOurSWCg1vQ	4	2009-06-25	2	1

The hubs ordered Mongolian Beef (his fav at PF Chang's) and I ordered my """"tried and true"""" Ginger Broccoli and Chicken."""" Of course we started with the Lettuce Wraps because honestly...they are just the most delicious things ever!Tonight we were pleasantly suprised that the food was quite delicious. Although the dishes are EXACTLY like what you would get at PF Chang's they are scrumptous in their own right. The only downfall is that the noise isn't conducive to conversation.  I haven't been to an establishment this noisy since Buca de Beppo's...which I love (don't get me wrong)!  But I will say (on a positive note) that the customer service is fabulous! Something that can be hard to come by at times...As for price....$28 bucks for the two of us including an appetizer, two entrees and two drinks. (coke and iced tea...with free refills) Seems a bit pricy to me but honestly....EVERYTHING is expensive now days. Overall, try it out...they offer take out too so you can enjoy great food in the comfort of your home....without all the noise!

We were served quickly and the staff was friendly! The restaurant was clean and tables were bussed quickly. I was disappointed with my Mongolian chicken. It tasted more like Teriyaki and was swimming in sauce. I had at least a 1/3 cup of sauce left on my plate after eating my food.All in all, PeiWei's food will be why I don't return anytime soon even though their staff was excellent and so was the atmosphere.	jQsNFOzDpxPmOurSWCg1vQ	2	2014-10-01	0	0

0	R-kL1bocHgP4GW7Mgd-ZXA	nI2rhDM2CgNazMdhiODoRQ	OH MY GOD, this place. I used to like Pei Wei until I moved to Surprise and this location ruined it for me. They consistently screw up on orders, have huge wait times, and run out of key ingredients on an alarmingly regular basis. We just spent an hour waiting for a take out order (kung pao veggies and vegetable fried rice), which was twice the time they quoted us, only to be told they were out of WHITE RICE (how does a chinese restaurant fail to foresee the possibility that they might serve a lot of white rice on a Saturday night?!). I may have chosen to stick around the extra 15 minutes if they hadn't already had to re-make half my order after making it incorrectly the first time. When I change up an order even slightly to accommodate for allergies/dietary needs, they have to re-make it at least 75% of the time.If the food was consistently delicious, I'd rate it higher, but honestly, it's only okay.	jQsNFOzDpxPmOurSWCg1vQ	2	2016-02-14	0	0
5	6jz_Yr6_AP2WWLbj9gGDpA	sb7iYaCc6ggpShtElkcwiw	My wife wanted to try this place for awhile now.  One of her brothers friends used to be a manager of one in Colorado too.  Tonight we decided to try it out.I placed my order online.  Easy process.  My wife went with an order of Chicken Lo Mein and I went with Sesame Chicken/Steak with fried rice as well as an egg roll and 2 pot stickers.  Total for everything was $24.80 after tax.  I drove down and picked up my food.  The manager their was friendly, rang me up real quick and I was out the door in no time. This bag was heavy as hell too!   Here is how everything tasted.....................Chicken Lo Mein-  Only had a little of this.  Good noodles, good white meat chicken.  My wife liked it.Sesame Chicken/Steak-  I decided to try out 2 kinds of meat.  They let you mix and match which is cool...they charge you for the highest priced item.  I substituted fried rice for white rice (.99 cents extra).  This was touted as soy citrus glaze, red bell peppers, onions, scallions, ginger, garlic and chile paste and sesame seeds.  It was just alright.  The flavors didn't really do much for me.  It was a tad spicy from the chile paste but overall it was kind of bland.  I had some pieces of steak/chicken that were a bit funky too.  I would definitely try out a different dish next time here...if there is a next time ;-).  The fried rice was good!Egg Roll- Eh.  It was an egg roll.  Nothing fantastic about it but it tasted fine.  It came with a sweet mustard dipping sauce which was pretty tasty.  Usual fillings of pork, veggies etc.Deep Fried Pot Stickers-  I got 2 of these things.  They were good.  Small but good.  Straight pork filling in the middle of them.  Overall it was just alright.  I will say that they give you a GRIP of food.  The 2 entrees we got could have easily fed 1-2 more people.  For $24.80 it was a great value.  The food just wasn't the type of thing that  you would ever crave and keep you coming back though.  While I was eating my meal, all I could think of were better Chinese food places I have had before....wishing I was eating them instead.  It filled my belly, service was friendly and the value is definitely there.  I'll probably give them another try and order some other dishes to see if there is something I really like.  We shall see............	jQsNFOzDpxPmOurSWCg1vQ	3	2015-02-12	7	6

(we didn't know it was a like share the bowl type of place, and when we figured it out we didn't do it because hers had meat). But overall this place was amazing. The employees are very very nice!

The food was greasy (I guess most Americans would love it since they don't see the difference) The manager had the audacity to compare this restaurant with PF Chang which is equally greasy and bad. I wouldn't recommend this place to any health conscious people. To top it all its expensive. Go to taco bell or China Panda and save your frustration and your appetite.

Sorry to say we were quite disappointed with our Pad Thai orders today, so much sauce that it resembled a thick soup.  The egg ingredient seemed to be overlooked and was in big slices rather than smaller curds,  when I asked a server about the sauce he replied that it wasn't really sauce but that the rice noodles were too wet.  Either way, it was not a pleasant dish today.	jQsNFOzDpxPmOurSWCg1vQ	2	2015-01-21	2	1

Sometimes they tell me they never even received my order when I received the confirmation email. Also, if you in during a busy time and have a teenage girl as a cashier, you're chances of having a pleasant experience with her are slim to none. This has happened to me multiple times with multiple different cashiers. I have spoken to the manager and he is always very apologetic, but I guess you just can't get stressed teenage girls to be nice to customers. I will continue to go here as the food is good for the price and they are relatively quick with preparation. Nice options if you're veggies as well.	jQsNFOzDpxPmOurSWCg1vQ	4	2016-02-13	0	0

Take out rocks, call ahead.  They remember your phone number and name, so when you call they already know you.  They also save your last order to ask if you want the same, or to add anything to it... Nice touch.  I think I eat there too much! The only thing I don't like, and I think I'm the only one who doesn't like it, is the soda machine.  Only because I always get a soda after someone has pumped out some nasty combination of orange soda and root beer, then I can taste it in my coke.  Wish they had some filter system.  Otherwise, I could eat here daily.  Find me here at least once a week! :)	jQsNFOzDpxPmOurSWCg1vQ	5	2012-07-08	2	1

The Mongolian beef was delicious, however the white rice was undercooked, some of the rice was hard still and crunchy.Honey crusted chicken also quite good, same story with the rice.  Same thing with the sweet and sour beef.Ordered the Pad Thai without peanuts... Son is allergic to peanuts so we made it very clear we didn't want anything with nuts.  They deliver the pad Thai with peanuts all over the top.  Sent it back and they fixed it.They brought us spring rolls which we did not order.  We said they were not ours we ordered wontons.  They bring us the wontons a few minutes later.  The wontons are less expensive than the spring rolls, we point that our to the guy at the register and with a bit of smart-alecky-ness says that he """"let us keep the spring rolls"""" and """"didn't charge is for all of our drinks"""" as if he did us a favor.Overall the food was decent, the rice was terrible and the attitude of the cashier was not what I expected with a $65 food order!!I wouldn't go back for that price and food quality but perhaps we caught them on a bad day.."""	jQsNFOzDpxPmOurSWCg1vQ	2	2013-05-23	0	0

I really wish there was an awesome offering out there in terms of Chinese food.. Mexican food, oh yeah, some very good places mostly but Asian, youre better off staying at home and cooking. We ordered the Asian Chicken Salad, chicken was old and had that old gross fridge taste.. Dan Dan Noodle, the noodles were over cooked and stuck together as one large soggy noodle.. Curry with Tofu, the curry had a weird perfume taste.. the honey chicken was pretty good as well as the hot and sour soup though neither made for good leftovers. With Surprise having so many chains it wasnt surprising to see one of these finally opening up.. a far better choice than Panda Express.. kind of sad, huh?	jQsNFOzDpxPmOurSWCg1vQ	2	2008-11-27	8	6

Let me just say that, a man named Paul Fleming (PF) and (Flemings) is responsible for many of the restaurants that you and I frequent. His ex wife and him went through a bitter divorce her nickname is (Flow) and she operates """"Flows,"""" Chinese restaurants. Flow is Chinese and married another Caucasian man 20-25 years younger than her, who speaks fluent Chinese. Anyways, Peiwei's in my opinion is overpriced for the small amount of you receive for the consideration you give. In other words, there's no value for your consideration. Yes, I do enjoy the PeiWei Spicy chicken, extra spicy with water chestnuts, but at $12.53 for the water chestnuts and extra chicken, it's just not worth it. The rice is almost always dry and is cooked incorrectly in massive amounts, as well as being a long grain, not short grain rice. NOT WORTH THE MONEY!!!"""	jQsNFOzDpxPmOurSWCg1vQ	3	2017-06-10	5	3

The crab wontons are usually a sure bet at any Asian restaurant but for some reason it just always sucks ass here. Fishy weird taste that's contrary to what they should taste like and the sauce is garbage. Teriyaki Chicken was bland and shitty. Pei Wei Spicy dish was average at best only cuz of the sweet sugary sauce that masks the overall flavor. Now my girlfriend and I just feel like shit.. Why? Cuz it's shitty food. Also saw on the local news that the location on Glendale and 7th st. had 4 health code violations. I'm officially done with this place.

First I was unable to order online,   when I  went to pick up the food I brought  a gift card with a remaining credit on it and the remaining total written on top with a permanent marker which would have covered the entire cost of my meal. When I handed it over to the employee  she swiped the card and simply stated there is a zero balance on this card. To which I replied that can't be correct because the last time I used it the employee wrote the available balance on the top of the card for me. The cashier didn't seem to take me serious and simply asked for another method of payment. I was in a rush it was my lunch hour so  I paid out of pocket. The sauce on my food taste watered down over all a poor experience. To add insult to injury I later called the number on my gift card and they assured me that I did have a credit balance which leave's me wondering what are gift card's good for?

I couldn't believe it; it took them a long time to have my order ready but still manage to not cook it all the way.  I didn't realize it was frozen until I got back to work to eat it.  By then, I didn't have time to return to have them make me a new one.This is an expensive place for just sandwiches only.  My Panini alone was over $8 after tax.  Not a good value because it doesn't even come with a drink or side.  I appreciate and support local businesses whenever possible but after this mishap, I won't be back.	_mqUzNXs_sJ1EJYgYZYszg	1	2017-04-13	0	0

0	7a2OVx6IJTMpUtYDLPZhwA	Xd7fDGNp6wc_8mjPs0Unvw	I stumbled upon the Lunch Lounge while staying at the Aloft last week, and was thrilled that I did. It's kind of hidden from the street behind the Radisson on 44th St, but that didn't stop me from taking the short walk over from the hotel. Cute little place with great service and good eats! They have all kinds of sandwiches and salads, and couldn't decide what I wanted since the menu looked so good. They serve Boar's Head meats, which makes for an awesome sandwich. My friends who were staying with me raved about the food and said they wanted to come here for lunch again tomorrow. Only not so great thing was that they were out of the soup of the day, which we wanted to try, but since we did come about a half hour before they closed I could live with that. Wish we had more deli-type places like this in Milwaukee! Yummmmm!	_mqUzNXs_sJ1EJYgYZYszg	4	2014-11-22	0	1
1	bCj_W-14a7SmGKyYufPzZg	18RML0hSOiL4oWSpHefNfA	What a find!  While staying at the Aloft in Phoenix for business we found this on a morning walk.   We had the breakfast burrito and a breakfast panini.  Both were excellent!  The burrito was so large we agreed that it could have fed us both.The lunch menu looked great and I would like to try some of the sandwiches.We are here for a few more days and will eat here on Monday.If you are staying at a hotel in this area be sure to give it a try for a good quick breakfast or lunch.  You won't be disappointed.	_mqUzNXs_sJ1EJYgYZYszg	5	2013-04-05	1	0

0	CQ7tEwDL_5jpEJzDKKYv4Q	RH2Hzv7_erHGpDlXMvYWdw	Restaurant/Ambiance: Small cafe tucked away in a corporate office park. Has a Modern but relaxed cafe vibe inside. Has about 12 or so tables inside with 3 tables outside. Typical clients are business execs and tradespeople on lunch break. No issue getting a table or parking space. Little difficult to find though.Food: Great selection of sandwiches. Quality meats and fresh veggies. I like the southwest chicken chipotle sandwich. Also excellent salad menu. They also have a great breakfast menu but I've never been there for breakfast.Service: Fast service, able to move the lunch rush pretty well.Overall: Great little lunch cafe!	_mqUzNXs_sJ1EJYgYZYszg	4	2016-08-04	1	0

I have worked across the street for 15 years and I am so thrilled to finally have good food in the area.  The Chicken Fiesta Wrap is my favorite (I CRAVE it) and the California Club is really good too (crispy bacon....yummmm). If you can get there before they run out of Tortilla Soup it is outstanding. The food is always consistent and they don't seem to cut corners. Reasonably priced for what you get and what's in the area. Fast service, wifi on site, nice staff...I seriously cannot say anything negative.  Thank you for saving our lunch dilemma in the area!	_mqUzNXs_sJ1EJYgYZYszg	5	2016-03-10	0	0

I had the lunch roast beef special and it was really good. The red potato salad seemed to be missing something for my palate, but over all it was really good! Meat was tender, taste was good and no overpowering sauces. Its a bit cramped in there so a togo order is a good idea, but its close to my other office so it makes for a perfect stop. Service was fast considering the crowd at lunch and the patrons and employees seemed to know one another.Its a nice place if you are in the area, stop by and have lunch!	_mqUzNXs_sJ1EJYgYZYszg	3	2015-07-31	0	0

0	ktdSILM4nVCPAzVVVQmB_w	XcARF3jBueZcmXNyfr6gNQ	I feel like this place has gotten worse over time, and it feels as every time I try to go back, they fail to meet the mark somehow. I used to frequent it when my work first moved into this area, about 4 years ago, but I think today was the draw for me. They forgot to include dressing with my $9 salad. Also, without the dressing, the chicken has a strange taste, almost questionable, which makes me wonder how it has tasted in the past...at least I got extra spinach. The initial reason I started going here less often was a noticeable decrease in their salad sizes a few years back, hence I ask for extra spinach. One good thing they have going for themselves is that the veggies they use in their salads always taste fresh, for that reason I gave them two starts instead of one. However, I expect better for the price they ask for their food. Today was my last visit and I will make sure to spread the word at work.	_mqUzNXs_sJ1EJYgYZYszg	2	2017-01-10	0	0

I had the best lunch ever -  a Southwestern chicken chipotle panini.  OMG!  The guy behind the counter turned out to be the owner, and himself grew up in a family owned East coast deli.  I had several expensive meals during my trip, but nothing was as tasty as my Lunch Lounge experience!  I made sure I had time for a breakfast stop on my way back to the airport., and was again wowed with a huge breakfast burrito, great latte and a smile - all for less than my daily NYC latte and muffin.  My  client has never been to The Lunch Lounge, so next time I am in town, we have a lunch date at the best undiscovered charming cafe in Phoenix!

0	e0TeYGOQRM2PrYCAdho7lg	eizIAeDy6K9bVFqjQ_j9mg	"""I visited this restaurant because I got a groupon now deal. When I walked In and the older woman standing there took about 5 minutes to acknowledge that I was standing there at the counter waiting to be served..Finally she said """"whenever your ready.."""". I told her hi how are you, giving her a nice reminder that that is how your supposed to greet new customers in your establishment. That on its own turned me off because I hate giving my money away tobusinesses that don't appreciate me.  I don't feel like I am asking for much in exchange for coming back and supporting local businesses. As I was standing waiting for my food I overheard the employees (including my o so pleasnt serve lady) complaining about the groupons that kept coming in.. while I was standing there! Rude! The older man behind the counter making sandwiches was very nice. He is the only reason I am giving two stars. The food on the other hand was decent. Too bad I won't ever becoming back just to be treated like I am bothering them.. next time I will just eat mcdonalds breakfast like I wanted anyways."""	_mqUzNXs_sJ1EJYgYZYszg	2	2013-06-20	1	1

I had the Thanksgiving lunch special - turkey, stuffing, cranberry jam, and I held off on the cheese. Nicely toasted bread - all in all, a decent lunch!	_mqUzNXs_sJ1EJYgYZYszg	3	2012-10-21	1	2

The owner took my order a few weeks back and recommended the Stromboli since I always ordered the Roast Beef Press (which is fantastic!). O. M. G... the Stromboli is the best sandwich I've ever had. Inside out sub roll, pesto, ham, pepperoni, salami, cheese, and cherry peppers - toasted on a panini press. Seriously? On my day off from work, I drove 30 minutes back there to take family there for lunch. If they served dinner, I'd have to think about moving closer.	_mqUzNXs_sJ1EJYgYZYszg	5	2015-01-28	0	0

Both were good choices, but seeing how happy she was with her choice I have to come back to try that one next.  Plenty of off-street parking.  I only wish this place was open on weekends (although given their location I can understand why they are not).  Maybe open a second location near the business park at University and Elwood (hint, hint)?  I'm pretty sure it would be a big hit.	_mqUzNXs_sJ1EJYgYZYszg	4	2014-08-15	0	0

Whether it is breakfast or lunch you can't go wrong with trying this place for a simple, but gourmet, breakfast sandwich or a dressed up salad for lunch. I only gave them four stars for this type of venue because I felt they were a bit understaffed when I arrived around 10am. Don't hold this against them. It was a bit of a wait for a sandwich but the quality is well worth the wait. The dill on the breakfast sandwich was a nice touch. The outdoor seating was nice on a cool morning.	_mqUzNXs_sJ1EJYgYZYszg	4	2014-03-25	2	0
0	IMZn7MiH9aEeiw-YCBSN1g	vicugCEbW4gj3sLVR65Jxw	First time trying this place. I got duck fried rice (which I've never had before) and it was pretty good. It was different from the fried rice I'm used to but less greasy so maybe not a bad thing. Teriyaki chicken was good although not the best we've had.  Cheese puffs are gross.definitely not a Rangoon or crab puff and waaay too sweet for my taste. It was okay but I'm still looking for something awesome out here in Goodyear and this simply isn't it. It's the best option we have found, but nothing compares to our favorite joint out in Peoria (Big Heng on 75th & Peoria).	n8KZA9G4FvGqDBWIscpz9Q	3	2013-06-01	0	0

This establishment has always stayed consistent with their food as far as taste. Our favorite's are egg rolls & egg drop soup with hot tea. We've tried all their main entrées & they are all delightful. At the end you'll be surprised & satisfied with the pricing. Highly recommend this restaurant.	n8KZA9G4FvGqDBWIscpz9Q	4	2016-02-22	0	0

When we were done the older woman even boxed up and bagged my food for me. 5 stars for the service.But the reason I only gave 4 stars is because we ordered the orange chicken lunch combo, the sauce was too runny and didn't taste like orange chicken to me :( I was bummed. The lo mein was bland and the fried rice was dark and greasy. Couldn't eat it. My man ordered the sweet and sour chicken lunch combo and he liked it but we both thought they could use more flavor! Good prices though!	n8KZA9G4FvGqDBWIscpz9Q	4	2016-06-30	0	0

We ordered the sweet and sour pork, and orange chicken with brown rice (a nice option). The portions were more than enough for two and I tore it up the next day at work. No one was in there when I came in, hopefully this place picks up because I hate seeing the small guys loose it in this big dog world. :)	n8KZA9G4FvGqDBWIscpz9Q	3	2011-06-22	0	1

I usually get the sesame chicken. It is so crispy, and the sauce is amazing. And when they have it, I'll get the duck. As far as duck goes this place a pretty good job preparing it. Duck is usually very greasy, but they do a pretty good job, not the best I have ever had but close to. The egg drop soup is the best I have ever had though. The only problem I have had is the service, could use some work. Waited like 15 minutes to get the check, had to make it known to the waitress.	n8KZA9G4FvGqDBWIscpz9Q	4	2016-11-27	0	0

Most of the food lacked seasoning and I felt they were skimpy on ingredients.  Finally, when ever I have ordered a meal with fried rice, it at least had vegetables. So I was disappointed to open my meal and find plain fried rice.  I didn't really feel that there was much heart in the cooking. I will not be revisiting this place.

First mapquest sends me in the wrong direction, then when I call for help the server tells me it's across from Lowe's? It would be clearer to say it's across from Walmart! I ordered Cheese Puffs (I should have known to change my order when I asked if the cheese puffs were wontons or rangoon and the lady on the phone said """"no cheese puffs""""). I half accepted some deep fried Chetto. But this was actually the only enjoyable part of the meal. Honey Sesame Shrimp was over cooked with little taste. It was suppose to come with shrimp fried rice but instead I was given tasteless brown rice and a vegetable spring roll that I never tried because the rest of the meal was so disappointing. This is in no way authentic and I bases on my experience it was barely good on a Sunday night. But maybe that's because I forgot to pray over it since I was so hungry.

0	1ghFOCMBpo2bGaWu_c1tcg	5ReBTtjrGGSJeFQjDBjrEw	Was not impressed.We ordered take out and got their family meal ... something like 3 dishes with rice, noodles and egg rolls for around $35.  Great deal and a LOT of food but it did not taste good.  They put way too much corn starch to thicken the sauce (which is normal but the over did it) and the broccoli was waaaay too soggy.  Our egg rolls were over cooked or the oil wasn't clean b'c they were way too dark and had like burnt spots.Mapo tofu wasn't bad.  I asked for non-spicy and they cooked it as requested.  Broccoli beef was terrible - the broccoli was way too soft (and I actually don't mind soft broccoli but seriously, this went overboard) and like I said, too much cornstarch.  I thought the sweet and sour pork wasn't bad but apparently the hubby didn't like it.  Go figure 'cuz I'm the Asian one inthe relationship!Places like these, I definitely think you need to try for yourself b'c our tastebuds are so different but coming from somebody who knows Chinese food, I wasn't impressed the least bit ... except for the quantity ... very generous portion!	n8KZA9G4FvGqDBWIscpz9Q	2	2012-06-24	1	0

1	icMCEESVs2TU_NkIZM142w	AgCbT6-GxthR6V6jlw1ALA	"""""""This place is amazing.  As far as I'm concerned, it's the best in the West Valley.""""  Really?  The best?  I admit that, when it comes to Chinese food, there isn't much in the West Valley.  Then again, unless we're talking Mexican, there isn't much in the West Valley ... period.  It's been that way since I came out here in 1993; it'll probably be that way after I die of food poisoning from one of these stellar places (and after one of the restaurant owners I've reviewed reads one of my contributions, the """"food poisoning"""" may not be so accidental or coincidental).First, I really like the nearly all-wood decor of the place.  I know the """"fashion"""" for those who aren't old and obsolete dinosaurs is plastic and glass.  Whatever.  I like wood.  It gives a warm and cozy feeling and this place has it  (the ceiling with twinkling stars ... ehhh ... it's okay).We had the family dinner for two.  The price ($23.95 + tax without drinks) is reasonable.  The Hot n Sour soup was tasty:  filled with peanut oil just like the Hot n Sour Soup I'm used to from back East.  A little light on the meat and a bit too sweet for my tastes, but acceptable.  The egg rolls had nearly no meat and were very crisp.  Frankly, I LIKE all-vegetable and crispy egg rolls and the tighter the cabbage is packed in, the better.  Cheese puff ... okay.  Wasn't supposed to be a """"crab puff"""", so they're not trying to deceive and it was tasty.Now the main meal.  This is where the place gets less """"amazing"""".  I had the Szechuan Chicken and am wondering if maybe they brought the wrong dish?  I've never had a version of this dish, where the chicken was crispy coated and the sauce was sweet.  My other half had the Kung Pao Chicken and it was, sadly, standard for second-rate Chinese restaurants:  small cubes of celery, bamboo, zucchini ... and smaller cuts of, I think, chicken.  Neither tasted bad; neither overwhelmed.Service was fast ... one might say, """"too fast"""":  in a take-out situation, you WANT them falling over each other.  At a sit down meal, you really don't want them bringing courses before you're done with the previous one.  As I said to my fellow diner, """"The only thing missing is them standing in a corner, watching expectingly and waiting to swoop down on us as we took our last bite.""""So, in conclusion, while I agree that the pickings in Avondale/Goodyear are slim, this is no excuse to tolerate something one step above the food court in Target.  If you really think this place is something to give 4 or 5 stars to, then I beg you to either get in your car and drive the 20 miles into Phoenix to find something more palatable or, if you don't have a car, drop me a line and we'll go out to dinner one day.  I'll consider it a civic duty and a generous gift to your taste buds."""	n8KZA9G4FvGqDBWIscpz9Q	3	2014-01-12	1	0

The interior of the place is done very nicely, they definitely put a lot of effort into the atmosphere of the place. I am used to many Chinese places being completely bare bones in terms of interior, so this was a pleasant surprise.Also! on a side note, I was so happy to find a local place that has good boba / pearl tea drinks.

The service was pretty quick (3 different servers), they all helped out each other.  Ok, here is the food comments:  Thai Satay Chicken Skewers - they were dry, tough, and not grilled (I think it was fried).  The peanut sauce that they were covered in was not peanutty enough.  BBQ Pork Slices - the flavor was good and a little greasy, but the slices were inconsistent.  You get super thin slices and they normal slices.Beef Egg Foo Young - The beef and gravy was ok but the veggie egg platters a little on the burnt side.  We overhead the couple on the other side of us complain about their food.  So, I am not sure if it was an off day or this was their normal quality of food.  I would good back to Ono Hawaiian (fast food) which is cross the parking lot next time I feel Asian.	n8KZA9G4FvGqDBWIscpz9Q	2	2011-02-15	4	1

We got takeout here all the time after work. The food was always good every time, and they were always very friendly! We would generally just split an entree because they are so big, but they would still give us at least 2 fortune cookies and enough supplies for 2 people. (Many places we've ordered takeout from only give you one fortune cookie for one entree... not really a big deal since we don't even eat them, but I thought it was a nice touch here at AJK. It's the thought that counts! They are very thoughtful! :)We recently decided to dine in for the first time, and we were just as satisfied as before. The food was the same quality as take out of course, but the service was phenomenal. It wasn't very busy at all, and everyone was extremely polite. We had Plum Wine and Oolong Tea, but quickly realized we needed some cold water with the hotness of our food! Both spicy and temperature... It was all very good though! Our favorite thing to get there is the cream cheese rangoons, and they are the best we've ever had! So delicious! I could eat tons of them for my entire meal, but I don't ;)Some of the dishes we've ordered weren't so great here, but that's just personal preference. What we do like is excellently prepared, and we've never really been disappointed. The dinner for two thing we had when we dined in was a mistake... it was more like dinner for 3 or 4!!! Or maybe we're just not American enough. One entree and 1 or 2 appetizers would be enough... the dinner for 2 came with spring rolls, cream cheese rangoons, soup, a huge plate of rice, and 2 entrees. We had tons of leftovers, which was okay with us I guess! You definitely get your money's worth here though.Oh, and the place is small, but very nice inside. Nice atmosphere... nothing spectacular, but it's comfortable and quiet. They also had 2 flat screen TVs that I saw, but I didn't really pay attention to what was on.

I usually go for the chicken and broccoli, and if you get it to go they'll give you enough food for 2 or 3 meals. I am still on a quest to find the perfect eggroll though...you know the big fluffy golden brown ones with pork and shrimp in them (I'm from NJ and that's what they're like there) and still no luck. But this place is a breath of fresh air considering the best Chinese food we had around here was Panda Express...and Chinese food shouldn't come from a fast food restaurant.	n8KZA9G4FvGqDBWIscpz9Q	4	2011-05-17	1	0

The food is very good.  Im gluten intolerant and they do not hassle me when I ask for no soy sauce on my food.  They even said I can bring my own.  Im giving them a 4 because they do not offer gluten free breading or gluten free soy sauce for their meals.  The ambiance is elegant and traditional looking..very pretty.  They have bundle dinner specials, that is quite a savings.  You can also substitute the white rice for noodles or brown rice for a small fee.  I like that option because white rice is not the healthiest.

This is the best and only chinese food I eat here in arizona since I moved here from Cali. Well atleast on the West side I don't go to the east side very often. I love their egg rolls and the Lo Mein Noodles, those are my favs, however the lunch special are a fabulous hit as well, price good and a enough to have left overs for later, I always order the #6 Garlic Chicken w/all noodles and a extra egg roll, because did I mention the noodles and egg rolls are my favs. So if your ever on the west side of town get off at Dysart and it's on the right side of Fry's.

I felt bad about it, but the cashier was nice, and the fellow who handed us our burgers jokingly said that they were made with love.  It seems odd to say it, but he sounded genuinely sincere.  Ordered two cheeseburgers with extra everything, a double-double, and two fries.  Fries were piping hot / crispy, single burgers were heavily laden with at least 2.5 times the normal veggies -- unusually large for 'extra everything.'  I wouldn't normally leave a review for an In N Out, but everyone we spoke to was very nice, and they served us so close to closing.  Thank you!"""	qU4wrOVqDfddr9PP_ssmUA	5	2015-02-11	2	0

I've lived in California twice, and everyone there is obsessed with the place.  I can remember my first time visiting and thinking, meh, it's just ok.  So, I walked in to the Dysart location and stood in line for fifteen minutes and then waited ten more minutes for my food.  My opinion: meh.  Their fries are good, but their burger is nothing special.  Five Guys and Whataburger beat it hands down, every day of the week.  So next time I was hungry, that's exactly what I did....go across I10 and get something that I enjoy.	qU4wrOVqDfddr9PP_ssmUA	3	2013-06-03	1	1

OK, don't get worked up. It just didn't thrill me.  It was fresh, well made and just fine.  I just don't want to build a temple in the building and worship it like others seem to!  I got a double double with onion (and when they mean with onion, they mean it!), fries and a chocolate shake.  I liked the burger (could have done without the special sauce, which to me is just thousand island), liked the fries, although they needed more salt and loved the shake (perfect consistency and chocolatey taste).

Pulled them out for of course it left that nasty seeded snail trail.  Yuck but I can deal.  Then my son.  Eating his 4x4 and get to almost the last bite and finds a bug in it.   It looked like possibly a large mosquito.  Not sure.   It was some large winged thing.  I took it in and pointed it out to the lady at the register and she thoroughly examined it like I was a liar trying to get out of it or something.   They replaced it about 15 minutes later.  Just an overall bad experience.  This is a very fast paced in n out so I try to look past the dirty tables and full trash.  But bugs? Can't let that slide.	qU4wrOVqDfddr9PP_ssmUA	2	2017-02-04	0	0

The flow of traffic in and out from this restaurant business is awful. Lines build up and just finding parking in their small lot is a nightmare.

I was a bit suprised that my food was out right after I ordered (accidentally almost grabbed someone else's; they called 74 and I thought I heard 94). Anyways, the maximum capacity for the dining area is 71 people, so if your planning on having a party, bring under 71 otherwise your 72nd friend will have to sit outside (and no one likes to sit by themselves).Pro's:1. This In-N-Out is in a really good location. Right off the freeway; you can go off the freeway, grab your food, and go back on.Con's:1.

The only good thing about the food was you can taste how fresh the lettuce and tomatoes. Also the girl at the drive through was nice, that's about as all the good things I can say. I'm so disappointed, I was really wanting an awesome meal since I didn't feel like driving to a restaurant in old Scottsdale and waiting for my food and being even more hungry. Either way I will not eat In-N-Out ever again, just not my cup of tea lol. I only give two stars to places I will never eat again.	qU4wrOVqDfddr9PP_ssmUA	2	2013-10-20	1	0

April 3, 2013 I did my weekly visit to the restaurant to enjoy pizza and drinks with some friends.  In walks a young man and a young woman who were set at the table just next to me a few feet.  On his waist band was a 9 MM pistol.  I am fully for gun rights, as I own one as well, however what I am not for is eating dinner in a family establishment with loaded handguns strapped to other patron's waists.  Every one with in distance of the gun (which had a significant clip attached to it) asked why he felt he needed it in the restaurant.  What we all concluded was this establishment must not be safe if he feels it is necessary to arm himself as he did.  Spinato's allowed this man to carry this in to their establishment as under Arizona law they could choose to keep them out.  I loved you Spinato's, but I simply don't feel comfortable sitting three feet from a random stranger who is armed to the hilt and could take every one out in a matter of minutes.  I think it is fair to say we can all enjoy your pizza without a 50 clip strapped to our waists.  Or is your establishment so unsafe I should arm myself next time I come?  Unfortunately, I won't ever take the chance again.  I DEFINITELY will miss you...(I changed my rating from 5 to 3...the food I give a 5, the environment I now give a 1---makes 3 a good compromise).

Pat's excels at the New York thin crust while Spinato's has a great deep dish Chicago version that is excellent and not at all greasy.  The sauces (both the pizza and the pasta) are great and you can get extra on the side.  In the rare event you are still hungry I'd say get frozen yogurt across the street and skip the desserts which are a bit weak.  But how can you not love a family restaurant that feels like every pizza place in America?	TolwZ3L28or4E8SVTZUf6Q	4	2012-09-17	1	0

I can honestly admit that this place was the second best pizza joint I've been to in my life (the first being some random italian mom and pops in NY that I forgot the name of). The spinach pizza was extremely tasty, the sauce and the cheese went hand in hand without overpowering the spinach. The calzone was very enjoyable. I haven't had one before, so I went ahead and decided to try it at a place that had good pizza, and the spaghetti calzone was a great compliment to the entrees. This was also the first place I've been to aside from Taps that actually has Blue Moon on tap, which is very cool.	TolwZ3L28or4E8SVTZUf6Q	5	2010-01-20	1	1

Upon arrival there was a short wait but definitely worth it.  We started off with the garlic bread as an appetizer.  It was THE best...an explosion of flavors in your mouth!  If you don't try it, you're missing out.We decided on a 14"""" thin crust pizza.  Menu claims it feeds 2-3 people. We were a party of two so I figured this would be adequate.  We ended up taking the majority of the pizza home because there was a lot left over.  Ummm, leftovers!  Next time we'll opt for a smaller size.  The service was impeccable.  Brittany, our server, was beyond cordial.  She checked on us at least five times  to make sure our needs were met.Overall, best pizza I've had in Phoenix.  Better than Pizzeria Bianco (in my opinion) and you don't have to deal with the average three hour wait.Prices are fair.

We were all exhausted and starving, but we couldn't wait to try a new place. We had a beer while we waited and were seated on time. The place is cozy, and the staff is super friendly. We started with the cheesy garlic bread. My friends were not excited until they tried it. Oh WOW, it's bursting with flavor. That cheese, that sauce, that garlic, that crunch. Oh. SO. GOOD.Then we carried on and had their meaty pizza (can't remember the name). It was friggin' amazing! The Italian beef was a really great touch that I didn't anticipate. The sausage had a delightful flavor and wasn't too fennel-y. The sauce is what landed the pizza in my dreams last night. It's a sweet sauce (which might be new to some). It's very close to some great St. Louis style pizzas I've eaten. The crust is crunchy and it's delivered brilliantly on a wire rack (to maintain the crunch).

We didn't try to calzone but saw lots of other customers who ordered them.	TolwZ3L28or4E8SVTZUf6Q	5	2013-06-29	0	1

The bad news is that they're gonna' be closed. The good news is that they more than likely are going to swing wide for you and a choir of heavenly angels will sing as you walk through. The bad news is that your Aunt Agnes, who used to like to pinch the crap out of your cheek until she kicked the bucket will be there to greet you. The good news is that she's going to hand you a box that says """"Spinato's"""" on it. You open the box.

Your piehole will be dripping, and as you lift a piece to your lips, even Aunt Agnes's pinching of your cheek will seem like a blessing. Yeah, it's that good. If they serve pizza in heaven, it's Mamma Spinato's. The good news is you don't have to croak to enjoy it. And they deliver. And it's hot!

1	yrGIgk5eaWy-eewLNv4KHQ	mYH90Zy4vh8i9ZCstJjw1Q	Spinato's originated from Chicago. If I lived in Chicago I would be happy about them moving to AZ. My wife and I shared a thin crust sausage, onion and greenpepper pizza and did not enjoy it. The pizza was bland, maybe it was missing the fennel seeds in the italian suasage that seems to give the sausage that wonderful flavor. I couldn't quite pinpoint what was missing but I'm guessing I won't be making another visit to Spinato's.	TolwZ3L28or4E8SVTZUf6Q	2	2010-12-08	2	1

I started liking pastrami instead of corned beef. I stopped watching the news on TV. Is this a function of aging? I don't know.One of the more dramatic changes has been my growing appreciation of the overall """"character"""" of a restaurant. I find myself much more willing to overlook small gaffes in the food preparation if the staff is friendly and knowledgeable, or if the ambience is cheerful and interesting in some way. It doesn't have to be fancy - but it can't be gloomy and boring.This was brought home to me today at lunch. Our friend Sue picked a place I had never been to - Spinato's Pizza. It's a family owned and run local chain with four locations. We went to the one at Bell and 16th Street. Sue brought along her friend/employer Lee. It happens that Lee's grandson works in Spinato's kitchen. He always makes it a point to arrive 35 minutes before his shift begins so he can take advantage of employee dinner and he appreciates being treated like family. The place is cute - decorated in red, green and white. There are striped awnings above the booths, and trellises with vines. The chairs are white with green (or red) seats, and the table tops are white with the Spinato logo in the corners. The patio has tables with red-checked cloths. We were warmly greeted , and our server arrived promptly to offer drinks.Ken and I ordered a large Spicy Italian pie ($19.50) with added ricotta. We also got a salad ($3.99). Lee requested garlic bread ($3.99, $4.79 with cheese), and a small spinach calzone, one of the house specialties ($9). Sue got spinach too, but in the form of a """"lil"""" (smaller than small) pizza ($7.50). The salads arrived first, notable mostly for their large size. While the ingredients were fresh, there was nothing exciting there. The olive oil and balsamic vinegar served with them were of good quality. The garlic bread, eight pieces in the order, was outstanding - lots and lots of fresh garlic and a generous amount of butter. You have to make sure that everyone you'll be talking to in the next few hours has eaten some too. The staff checked in frequently to ask if we were happy. The pizzas were served on a wire rack, a great idea since the thin crust remains nice and crisp. Instead of slices, our pie was cut into many small squares. I found that for some reason this caused me to eat less. The pizza wasn't loaded down with sauce, and it had plenty of toppings. I tasted Sue's spinach pie and it was really good. The spinach is marinated before being put on the pizza, and there's tons of fresh garlic. Lee's calzone was quite large - he took half of it home.The menu isn't extensive. Besides the pizzas (10 varieties, plus design your own)  and calzone (there's a spaghetti and meatball one) there are two pastas and five sandwiches. We didn't inquire about dessert. The story behind Spinato's is told on the back of the menu. The family was worried that when they left Chicago for Phoenix, back in the """"70's, they wouldn't be able to find good pizza. What choice did they have but to open their own pizza parlor?! As the family grew so did the number of parlors. While the prices aren't low, you can go to lunchclub.com and get a 25% off the entire bill coupon. Aren't coupons great!!I have to say that if I was doing a blind taste-test between Stumpy's pizza (see the archives) and Spinato's, I'd probably give the nod to Stumpy's. But if you add in those other factors which have become important to me, as a dining destination Spinato's wins. It's also won awards from Phoenix New Times, the Scottsdale Culinary Festival and City Search."""	TolwZ3L28or4E8SVTZUf6Q	4	2010-01-14	1	1
21	iL_CR-WQnveqrff9LecqAQ	M2sZPPh5_T052xy2ToTRUA	So the parental units call me up on Sunday and ask me if I want to meet them at this place they love called Spinato's. The catch, I have to meet them in a 1/2 hour coming from Scottsdale. Normally this wouldn't be a big issue, but I took lounging to a whole new level on Sunday, and I was looking pretty bedraggled. I quickly looked up Spinato's on Yelp, since my parents have been known to be hit or miss on some eateries. All great reviews, which made me really want to try it. The lure of a free dinner, (and seeing my mom) put my unshowered butt in gear! So I hopped in the car 15 minutes later looking slightly scary. Unfortunately, I couldn't wear a hat inside the restaurant, or I would have. Turns out it didn't really matter what I looked like anyway. At 5 PM on Sunday the crowd was right out of Cocoon, before they got in that pool! One lady even had her oxygen tank with her. I found myself wishing I could try it. I kept wondering if I breathed in that oxygen for a while, would I get some kind of wonderful, natural high???The place was packed, and it turns out those geriatrics really know their stuff. The food was great!We did the whole dinner family style. The antipasto salad with spinach was amazingly perfect, really the best I've ever had.  The garlic bread was deliciously, warm, garlicky, and crunchy all at once. The marinara sauce to dip it is was slightly sweet, but not in an obnoxious way. It was just the right counter balance to the garlic.The pizza itself was decent, not great, but decent. This is probably because I prefer thinner crust, and minimal cheese on the pizza, such as Grimaldi's, but that didn't keep me from eating it. It didn't keep me from having it for lunch the next day either! I will definitely be back for the antipasto salad with spinach & the garlic bread. I need to cut back on the pizza anyway. Oh, and the service was amazing. I don't even think we had one wait person. Anybody you asked for something immediately brought it to you! Seriously, nothing phased them. Love it, and hopefully I'll be back soon!	TolwZ3L28or4E8SVTZUf6Q	4	2008-07-30	17	16

0	DPitNu466172os6m0Yri1Q	zJCgYSNN_zvs_5vfpD71MA	I've been to Spinatos a few times now.  I've had the famous spinach, the Chicago, and the Super Six.  All of their pizzas look delicious and are generous with the toppings.  The first couple of slices were overwhelmingly sweet.  Almost too sweet for my liking.  That being said it kinda grew on me and before I knew it I ate almost half of the first pizza.  I dont think Id ever order the spinach again but the Chicago and Super Six I would recommend.  The prices are a bit high.  ~20 bucks for a medium Super Six before tip is a bit much for a pizza in my book.  Spinatos does not crack my top 5 in the Valley but I would definitely recommend you trying it if you are a general fan of pizza.	TolwZ3L28or4E8SVTZUf6Q	4	2011-06-02	1	0

After buying one of those playing card decks with restaurant discounts, we finally tried Spinato's (after living in Phoenix since 2003). Yes, I fully realize how ridiculous it is that I hadn't been here sooner. There are so many great things about this restaurant ranging from the service, food, deals (coupon and daily deals), and conveniences (order ahead while waiting for a table). From the time we sat down (both visits), the service was top-notch and friendly. First visit, we had the specialty spinach pizza with plenty of garlic and tomatoes ($15 for a medium). It was delicious but way too much pizza for us 4 when we paired it when their large order of ravioli and two meatball. That was so good too! Oh did I forget to mention the garlic cheese bread that we ordered with the baked bread and butter. Both, simply amazing. Clearly I was aiming for the food going straight towards my waistline. I also had a glass of wine since they are half off on Sundays and made sure to get some of their chocolate chip cookies to go. For the second visit (a week later), we dialed it back a bit. Of course we had to have the garlic cheese bread, kids ravioli ($5 for the ravioli, a breadstick, drink, and scoop of gelato), small specialty pizza ($10 and plenty for my husband and son to share) and I had the """"lil"""" spinach calzone (7"""" for $5). That calzone was so delicious, I couldn't save the half I set aside for lunch. Add two glasses of wine (half off), and two piccola brownie desserts, and our total bill was $45. For a family of four with drinks, an appetizer and 2 desserts???? Pretty damn reasonable in this day in age. And it has been a long time since I was that blissfully satisfied with a meal (or two). Well done Spinato's, well done."""	TolwZ3L28or4E8SVTZUf6Q	5	2012-04-24	4	2
3	YX98pz7G4n0wqMmyfmxYuQ	Vk4CaVgbNAXlLAZpH-Q_rw	A little background.... My husband is from a sleepy community about an hour south of Chicago. My husband could/would eat pizza everyday of his life if I permitted. When we went back to visit his parents he actually took me on a pizza tour of the area all of which ended with his absolute favorite pizza, Aurelio's. His love for this pizza stems from childhood and I honestly do not think you could convince him that there is a greater pizza out there. I even once looked into shipping Aurelio's for a birthday present and quickly realized that that was insanely expensive. Fast forward to this summer when I discovered a review on Yelp that mentioned that there used to be an Aurelio's here in AZ that eventually became Spinato's. Well my husband insisted that we get in the car that moment and check it out. The sweet marinara is exactly what he was looking for and while not exactly the same this is the closest pizza in Arizona to his beloved favorite. The crust is thin and the sausage is hand crumbled (or appears to be). They are very generous on the cheese and toppings in general and leftovers the next day aren't too shabby. We have never had an issue with service or our order on the several occasions we have been One of my favorite things about Spinato's is the ice, seriously I have a passion for crushed ice and lots of it!

I have ordered carry out and delivery many times from this place and have never had a bad experience.  Everything is always really fresh.  When I have done carryout the employees were always nice and attentive.  The delivery staff is always good as well.  Delivery has taken up to an hour at times on lunch, so just be prepared.  The food is still good, hot, and fresh when it arrives and is worth the wait.  Sign up for their email coupons and you will have a pleasant surprise every year the week of your birthday.  Bottom line, if I were to move from Phoenix and come back for a visit, my first food destination would be Spinato's for the Italian Beef Calzone.	TolwZ3L28or4E8SVTZUf6Q	5	2013-06-30	0	1

0	fH_spVpnDn-k5dqEgEDUtA	m7lb_aqORqNBfFqa4IzA8Q	I came here because I wanted some pizza and I was hungry. Settled on a salad and a margarita pizza. The salad was intimidating because it came in a bowl. The next thing that came was the margarita pizza. It arrived a little different that I was expecting. Most pizzas come on the tray it was cooked on sort of. Well at least the size of tray it was made on. You know the standard metal pizza pan. Instead the pizza came on a round rack on top of the pizza tray.Then while trying to grab a piece of pizza I thought it wasn't cut all the way though. It look a while to figure out the pizza wasn't cut traditionally. it was cut every which way. The pizza was good, but it doesn't compare to my favorite pizza place. Some of the pizza didn't have topping on it. it was odd too because there wasn't a lot of cheese on it. There also wasn't a lot of sauce.I liked the crust of the pizza because it was crunchy and not soggy. I think I'd try some other pizza if I did go back. It was good, but I'd try something else. There was gelato there. I ordered two scoops vanilla and then one scoop dark chocolate. The dark chocolate was good. The vanilla was a bit sweet for me.	TolwZ3L28or4E8SVTZUf6Q	3	2012-03-10	1	0
0	uar1t8Hf08KK1LyicQ49tg	BgNDlnlz8xNf5siYWR1R3g	This is my FAVORITE place in Phoenix for pizza. I discovered Spinato's years ago when I still lived in Tempe/Mesa and my then-current girlfriend took me to their original Spinato's location on Smith, which is hidden away in an industrial park. Despite the obscure, hard-to-find location (even when you've been there before, it's very easy to drive right by it), this place is ALWAYS busy.There is nothing else around there to draw in business, at least not after all the industrial park offices close at 5pm. That is how good it is.I live in the Dreamy Draw area now and I get my Spinato's fix from their 12th St and Glendale location. My all time favorite is their sausage pizza. The cheese is very, very good. They make their own Italian sausage. There is something about the sauce OMG it is SO good, slightly sweet. As others wrote, this is Chicago thin-crust-style pizza, cut into squares. Oh, and the crust is so good too. I'm not gai for Chicago pizza but I just love Spinato's.Every single person - and I mean, EVERY SINGLE ONE - I have ever taken to Spinato's, they love it and they go back for more and introduce their friends to it. I cannot recommend them highly enough. Nello's gets lots of props in Phoenix but I promise you, Spinato's is better than Nello's.	TolwZ3L28or4E8SVTZUf6Q	5	2008-10-23	2	2
0	2jzwu-BTKEdFd5ZXlS4_oQ	ozQoWfrAr1fWiFJ-z5vSJA	I ordered online for take out. I got the margherita pizza and a spinach calzone. The pizza had no sauce on it. None. Not like any margherita I've ever had. The calzone had way too much garlic and it was really sweet. Also, everything was incredibly oily. Yuck. It was almost inedible. Also, there's a problem with their online ordering system. I ordered the pizza under my name. I had to set up an account with a password and everything. No big deal. When I placed my order the only option to pay was immediately instead of also at the pizza shop. My husband gave me his credit card to pay with and I did so. Still this is all fine other than the pizza shop losing out on a tipping opportunity but, whatever, not my business. When we got to Spinato's my order was nowhere to be found. They asked me if it could be under a different name and I said no I just set up my account and we already paid, what's going on with our order? Then as we're trying to figure out what happened we started going over what we ordered and then a man appeared with the food. My name was right on it. I pointed out that there's my name printed right on the piece of paper that's with the food. Then the lady behind the counter got a little condescending with her tone as she told me that the order is under the name on the credit card. I kept my name so me and my husband have different names. Why didn't she say this in the first place? Why the condescending tone? She might work there and know how the system is set up but, as a first time customer how would I? Also, if the food is under credit card name and they require that you pay online immediately when you order then why do I need an account unless they want to spam me for ordering food from them? or sell my info for extra $$	TolwZ3L28or4E8SVTZUf6Q	2	2013-05-27	1	0

We discovered Spinatos at the Culinary Festival years ago and have been going back since. We love the fact that its a family-owned business and that all the teenage kids work the place. The food portions are generous, the restaurant has a great Italian pizza place feel and they send you coupons for your birthday! Can't beat that.

I was skeptical.  Is it really that good?  Was he just really hungry?  NO!  From the minute he walked in the door - the pizza grabbed my attention.  From the smell to the look to the taste.  Hands down - best pizza I've ever had.  They don't deliver to our place, but it's well worth the trip down the 51 to pick it up.  The staff is alway nice and will remember you after a few trips.

My wife went ahead and reserved the table.  She was told it would be 45 minutes.  She came home and we began getting the kids ready.  We showed up 15 minutes before we were told, but they had already given the table away.  We were told that it would be another half hour before we could be seated.  Unfortunately, their waiting area is very packed and does not hold 8 comfortably.   We left, I will never go back.  It should not be a hassle to take your family out to eat.

I really enjoy the pizza here. My one complaint is, the thick crust pizza is so generic tasting, it is a pizza hut reminiscent thick crust. which in my mind. Not a good thing. The thin crust is the way to go if you come to spinatos	TolwZ3L28or4E8SVTZUf6Q	3	2012-02-02	1	0

They offer gluten free crust, willing to do no cheese and several sizes of pizza, so your party can get one or two pizza's for all or everyone can get their own preference.  I generally get the small size for myself, which leaves my with 30-40% of the pie for leftovers for breakfast or lunch.  Not bad to get 2 meals for $8-12. The Lil' size is usually enough for 1, if you will not be near a fridge in the near future.  My faves are the Spicy Italian and Canadian.  The services is always, friendly and the staff makes you feel at home!	TolwZ3L28or4E8SVTZUf6Q	5	2012-07-29	0	1

So as an adult I have missed out on all the great cusine known from this midwest mecca of a city.  This place makes me feel like I'm taking a journey away from the valley and right into a neighborhood restaurant in Chicago.  I love the pizza here as well as the down to earth relaxing atmosphere.  Servers have always been great to me.  I don't know how anyone could say anything bad about this place.  Until I take a vacation to the windy city, I'll have to come here to get my fill.

1	LwaLyCjnSPa-heLC2V2sqg	D1YlNVVkDTOzemHxUTYxeg	This store is absolutely filthy.  I went in to grab a quick dinner for my kids on their way to practice.  I read the exact order from my phone and had them make it.  As I was waiting I stood over by the drink area to get out of the way from the cashier to get out of the way of people trying to pay.  While I was there I noticed that the floor was sticky but looked up and saw a bottle of honey and figured someone must have spilled some.  I dropped off my kids dinner and then ran home to get some work I needed to catch up on and got a text that my daughters order was wrong.  Tough luck I told her, but just pick off what you don't like i'm sorry.  Not 2 minutes later my other daughter text that her food is also wrong, which kind of pisses me off because I literally read their order from my phone, and now they are both wrong??  I am literally sticking to my kitchen floor at this point so I take off my shoe to try and clean the honey off before I have to get out the door again and it wasn't honey, it was ***iING GUM!!!!  Disgusting!!!  So not only did I waste 22 dollars for food that will not be eaten, but now I have someones filthy gum stuck to the bottom of my shoe and I am pissed!  I called the manager because I was more pissed at this point about the gum than the sandwiches.  He of course was apologetic and offered to credit my card and to give us a free meal, which I refused because there is no way we will eat there again.  I just checked my credit card, and not only did he NOT credit my card, he re-charged me the $22.96!  So now I am just going to call my credit card company and refuse Both charges with them.  Employees are clearly not that bright, and the store is really dirty.  Don't eat here.	XpnkPS-56dYTdjwC8RRLuw	1	2017-02-21	2	0

At this location, you go to one side of the counter, a person takes your order on a piece of paper, then you grab your number and your tray and make your way down the cafeteria line and the staff start putting food on your tray if it's ready. Then you make your way to the end and pay for your food.All-in-all, the service is friendly and fine, but the process needs major improvement.

10	EXKDLuYoZUKUNNNYA7TlGQ	bmNHdm3iq5Ijkifi9fQfgw	I got a coupon in the mail for a free medium signature pizza. This is a crafty marketing strategy. I got hooked. The free deal required me to buy something at regular price so I got the garlic cheese bread. This was a good choice. I walked in and waited about 10 minutes for my order.The pizza has a hand tossed crust. The prep area is in full view of the front counter, so I watched the talented pizza chef toss my crust and top it. The pizza was hot and cooked to perfection. The toppings were abundant and evenly distributed. There is a generous amount of sauce. I like a saucy pizza. The sauce has a sweetness which works well with the seasonings. There is not too much cheese but just enough to get the melted strings when you bite into it. This pizza scores a 4 out of 5 for crust texture and sauce, cheese, and topping ratio.The cheese bread was good, but chewy. It had a nice flavor and came with marinara and ranch dipping sauces. It was a good deal along with the medium pizza. for $5.00. I also got a customer appreciation card to be punched every time I buy a pizza. The 10th one is free. So with this kind of deal and good quality, I will be making several return trips to Marco's.	BgwKts4y3DvZGCI0GogLpA	4	2016-12-08	17	14

0	q8p7bG92NmGMqb53ES-Ltg	hdaSpjMetDJCIki2MyBL3A	If you are reading this review because you are planning to eat sushi alone, look elsewhere. I am not reviewing the sushi!I will give the restaurant 3.5 stars and my food 2.5 stars. I was optimistic for my ramen dish, hoping to be reminded of the ramen, from many of the ramen shops in Japan. I was bummed with the serving size (for $11 with tax), but that is OK, I was most disappointed with was the taste. Maybe it was a fluke, or maybe something I did not agree with, it was oily and a bit too salty. The desert was a savior. Even though I can buy mochi balls for half the price and in more quantity elsewhere, I was glad they served it at their location. Convenience anyone? In addition, I like the black tea they serve, in a can. But the price was a little steep. If I'd go again, I'd just get water (I'll buy the tea on my own thanks). This place is tolerable if you want ramen. However, I cannot say anything of the sushi. I am not a big fan of sushi since I can only eat the non-shellfish variety. The atmosphere is lovely, the waiters are polite, and the service is bearable.	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	3	2015-07-03	0	0

We made sake bombs and they were fantastic!Between us, we ordered yellowtail sashimi, yellowtail roll, tempura vegetables, and a salmonskin roll.  The fish was great, really fresh tasting. The ratio of rice to sushi was perfect.I was glad to see that they have added outdoor seating.  This offers another option for diners who want to enjoy the weather and a much quieter dining experience.The best part of the evening was getting the check!  We ate well for under $50, an amazing feat for ANY meal, let alone sushi.  I will definitely be returning soon....good thing they're in the neighborhood!	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	4	2016-02-27	2	2

When asked why we did not get the option to sit at the bar the hostess shrugged us off. The food was not good enough to overcome the bad start. I didn't feel that the staff was friendly or rude.

So good, in fact, that each bite makes the lucky biter pause and savor.   I almost died without their salmon and tuna nigiri when I was preggers. (And maybe I snuck a piece or two, but don't tell.)2.  Fantastic Japanese dishes rare enough that you won't find them in other sushi restaurants. Be daring and explore uncommon foods off their specials board. I've never been grossed out, only happily wowed, even when a whole fish, with skin on, arrived in front of us on one occasion. Seriously, it was great.3. REAL wasabi if you ask for it. (Did you know that paste is not wasabi's natural state when observed in the wild?)4.  BYOB.  It's fun!  BYOS (sake) for even more fun.5.

I will not say that it was a disappointment, that would be unfair, because I really did like Hana.  I tend to be turned off by the slick over-styled sushi restaurants of Scottsdale, so I was immediately charmed by the homey neighborhood feel of Hana.  And the sushi was good.  Not the best I have ever had, but solid.  And who knows, maybe I didn't order well?  One can never tell.  I also must disclose that I went with my ex-boyfriend.  I'm sure this influenced my perception in some way.  He has issues with """"personal space"""", so being at the end of a crowded sushi bar with a server  reaching over us, which I must admit was in poor form (the serve could have easily taken two more steps to the edge of the bar instead of reaching over our heads) was not ideal.  Plus, I was out to dinner with my ex-boyfriend. Need I say more?  This is never advisable.  I may need to go back another night to sample the fare under more favorable conditions.  We shall see."""

They have a bizarre seating rule which I think others have posted about on here and it's true. The best time to arrive is right when they open. That way, you are guaranteed a seat. The place is very small and dark. Their food is absolutely incredible though. My favorite, hands down, was the lobster roll. Quite pricey, but SO worth it. I preferred a California roll from here and loved the flaming sugar cube that accompanied it.  Very cool to watch. I'm dying to return here soon.	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	5	2016-07-12	0	0

2	tLheyrfiF-gWCJbw0iEgJg	NqH6RQ3rJi8Spn_ZPGvuzg	I had the distinct honor of dining at Hana this past week under the special care of Lori, the owner.  I should preface this review by stating that I'm a travel and food writer who has traveled to more than 40 countries and all 7 continents....I'm a chef in Dallas...and I was in the top 5 on season 2 of MasterChef.  So the fact that my dinner at Hana was one of the best and most memorable dinners of my entire life should carry at least a bit of weight!  Phoenix, you are SO lucky to have this establishment.However, it wasn't the first time I had dined at Hana.  Scarcely 3 months before I had eaten sushi there with a local friend while passing through on my way to LA.  For her, Hana is the best place to get sushi in central Phoenix.  I had to admit, I was dubious about eating sushi in Phoenix, but the freshness and perfect presentation of the sashimi we ordered was stunning.  Still...for virtually all their regular customers, Hana is a sushi joint.My second experience was quite a bit different.  I was a guest of the owner, and she and her chefs took us through a 15 course menu that consisted of both strictly traditional Japanese presentations, and contemporary twists.  For more than 2 hours, the courses kept coming.They started with small bites...refreshingly simple, yet somehow complex, despite only 5 or 6 ingredients each.  One was a shooter on a base of Meyer lemon with monkfish liver, quail egg, bonito flake, and caviar.  Hot dishes soon followed...tempura lobster with a hot salted tea for dipping.  (It made me cry, it was so delicious.)  A custard of egg white and dashi broth that hid scallops and shrimp and crab at the bottom...so delicate it basically evaporated in my mouth.  (And I cried again.)There was no sushi on our table.  That doesn't mean there wasn't raw fish!  A mackerel was brought to the table, and we plucked off juicy delicate morsels of incredibly fresh fish.  (It's eyes were so clear it appeared to be looking around the room at me.)  Once we had finished, they whisked the skeleton off to the deep fryer, and returned the crispy bones for us to munch on.The fact that the chefs at Nana have the skill and ability to produce this kind of world-class meal just blows my mind, when I formerly thought of it as a mere sushi bar.  And the fact that it is BYOB...I thought I had died and gone to heaven.So here's what YOU need to do, next time you're ready for some food that will blow your mind:Walk into Nana.Ask for Lori, the owner.Tell Lori that Ben Starr sent you.Tell Lori how much you'd like to spend on dinner, whether that's $20 or $200.Tell Lori to show you something amazing.Forget about the menu.  Let the experts decide for you.  Lori will make sure you go home full of food that you will dream about that night, and tell friends about the next day.  Americans are not accustomed to dining this way, which is a shame.  There is a vast trove of knowledge, skill, and creativity hiding in the Hana kitchen.  It would be a crime to go there and order a California roll!I am still resonating with the memory of this meal.	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	5	2012-08-01	17	5

Being a brand new restaurant, apparently only one person (the server called him the """"Sushi Rock Star"""") has been employed behind the counter rolling up sushi! I hope Hana can audition some more rock stars because I am anxious to audition a tuna roll.The pork ramen had to suffice and it was served in a mammoth bowl at a temperature not unlike our galaxy's sun. After about 10 minutes, it had cooled off to the point where I could taste it and it was very good! Much better than those 73 for $1 jobbies at the grocery store.The atmosphere was dark, and facing the door it was a bit distracting. It was kind of like being in a dark, seedy bar and having someone stand there with the door open... I imagine. The service was excellent and the server friendly. I felt sorry for him having to tell subsequent customers that they weren't serving sushi. It's kind of like going to a luxury car dealership and being told they only have Yugos. But hey... even rock stars need a day off."""	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	4	2007-06-06	3	2

Maybe this is a one off but it was a horrendous experience: I called ahead for pick up- though I had given enough time they were still very late (talking 25 minutes real time here) getting it to me. I drove home realized they had given me the wrong order so I went back, the manager wanted the Ngiri I was given by mistake back, to give to another person after it had been in my possession for a good 40 minutes. Gave it back of course, just thought it's weird. And guess what they made me wait another 20 minutes even though I had called when I got home and realized it was the wrong order. Really a bummer because I wanted to try this place and have what otherwise seems a good place for sushi according to most people.	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	1	2014-09-17	0	0

Their teriyaki sauce is not too thick or too heavy like some other places which smother your food with the sauce. Hana puts just the right amount and they mix it with something so that it comes out right. Very beautiful food presentation. At atmostphere is very classy. The waitress is very nice and attentive and polite. The best Japanese restautant so far in Phoenix.	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	4	2017-03-09	0	0

0	JllIhZuuQnJqM6NUXMfxLQ	KmazbWCH9SCKfcIAz6Es-w	"""This is a belated review, but reviewing the other ones, I can see I'm not alone in my absolute disappointment for this place.We were a party of 2, and I had the dish with the buckwheat noodles. I wanted to try them. When the male server (probably the same notorious dark haired one found in other reviews) came by to ask me how it was, I said I didn't like it. He said, """"you're weird"""" and walked away. Who says to their customer they are weird?? I'm supporting this business by coming in here. I'm paying your salary (in part). But apparently it doesn't matter because this place is still in business. Didn't hurt them any when I didn't come back. I also didn't take leftovers home.  Obviously no tip. They were lucky I paid the bill. Anyone can do better than plunking down $40 here."""	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	1	2016-03-19	2	0
0	tCnrxQO1BfVkqC0z6R8g7g	EfgXLXEExrJM9fT30hHPMA	This is one of my favorite spots to go for sushi or really any Japanese food. Their ramen is delicious. This place is BYOB which makes it a fun place to go with a group. Just keep in mind it gets busy so if you're group is too large and it's a weekend, you might have a wait. Good thing you can drink and wait! I have yet to try anything on this menu that was bad. Don't forget to hit up their specials -- always a treat!	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	5	2015-10-09	0	0

0	QG9ZJatKSWj5p5VrW3cfMA	iC0zO71nZJBy3G4P-ntX5g	I kept hearing about how good this place was and with such a limited amount of sushi restaurants nearby, my husband and I decided to try it. We went on the Friday before Labor Day, so when we first walked in it was pretty slammed. It looked as if the small restaurant was overwhelmed with the fast paced staff, so we were a little worried about the service. It turned out we had nothing to be worried about, the service was great! We ordered the yellow tail nigiri, salmon skin roll and ebi yakisoba. The fish in the sushi was high quality and very fresh tasting (for Arizona). I don't normally order hot food, but decided to venture out and it was well worth it. The ebi yakisoba was very good, with shrimp that was marinated and cooked very well, and vegetables that were fresh and crunchy. I will definitely return.	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	5	2012-09-08	1	1

Plus, it's BYOB - a rarity it seems.I attended with a party of four and we spent about $110 and were stuffed on tons of food. The noodle dishes and sushi were great and our server was a lot of fun.

I seriously cannot claim having been to any one restaurant over 100 times!So this place must be good if Mike O. Is such a loyal, regular costumer. He must roll out of bed and saunter right into Hana!Oh wait, this review is suppose to be about MY experience at Hana. Well, I have to concur with Mike O. This place serves some darn good food. Not just sushi, the cooked varieties too. I've always liked eating here. Sushi is fresh, cooked items full of flavor. I don't always check-in when I eat here but doesn't matter, I don't think anyone is about to take the dukedom away from Mike O. !	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	5	2013-12-23	2	2

Always enjoy going out to dinner and having perfect customer service. Very friendly waitress, food came out quick and dishes we were finished with were taken away as soon as we had the last bite which I love because I hate a cluttered dining table when I eat out. We ordered a little too much because everything looked so good, but that's more of a observation than a complaint. Definitely one of those places I'd recommend to others without hesitation.  Just a tip. If alcohol is your thing, bring your own, as they don't serve any. Didn't bother me though I'll just remember for next time.	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	5	2014-04-23	0	0

0	sZCDmgrGyvHTrAha08KqDA	9Ig1U2hV6CPhSL8qQfn-MQ	This is my new favorite sushi place in the valley.  Every single time I've gone (and I've gone a lot in the past few years) it's been fresh and delicious.  The variety of rolls is great too for those who don't like traditional sushi.  The service is always great.  I've never had a bad experience.  It's small and sometimes it's super busy but service and quality never suffer.  I do wish they served beer and sake but that's my only complaint (and very  minor at that as you can always bring your own!).	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	4	2014-04-11	0	0

Like your sitting at a beach front restuarant in Phoenix. I was so so on Sushi until I found Hana. I recommend Hana over and over as the place to go, and every one that goes is estatic. The place is tiny but there is a patio area and also a bar counter which helps!	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	5	2013-08-20	0	0

2	KHAY_dctRO06RDOV31MJHg	KmGNBJOayGiLfc2UcYBXUg	I've had both great and sub-par experiences here so I gave it the middle of the road rating.The first time I was here, I was blown away by how different the sushi was and how they had things no other sushi bars seemed to have in Arizona.  The next 3 times I went back, Sunday, Sunday, and Friday back to back, I've been noticing things that I did not notice the first time.First, I would like to say that I believe that a waiter/waitress should not wear cologne/perfume.  I did not notice it the first time I went, but every other time, I noticed the guy bringing the sushi literally bathes in the stuff.  I'm about to eat a bite out of my 10$ per serving of Monkfish liver and catching a big wiff of [insert popular brand of men's cologne here] is not appetizing.  Especially since smell is so heavily associated with taste.  A very big faux pas in my book.After the great experience the first time, a few months later, I went 3 times in a row... back to back Sundays and Friday, I was able to notice that their specials didn't change in that time frame.  The chef's-here's-a-little-something-extra-you-didn't-order was the exact same also.  Maybe it's just me but I know a lot of places change their specials at least once a week.  How is the special still fresh if I see it every time I go?  I know the special is still there because they have not sold it out yet.  You know?Also, their tempura is really sub-par in my book.  I know it's pretty hard to not have good shrimp tempura, but it's really blah. I've been able to taste it every single time I went there (it comes out as a side to a lot of noodle dishes such as udon and soba) but it tastes really floury and oily, and it's pretty heavy, batter-wise.  Shrimp tempura should be very light, almost an airy crisp, but not here.  My fellow diners were all in surprised agreement their tempura really was pretty blah.  Also, if you really like the tempura sauce other places have; the warm savory dipping broth other places have with grated daikon radish, don't expect it here.  You gotta use your soy sauce.  :(Their cold soba noodles are very salty.  I've had to ask for a glass of ice and literally had to use the entire cup to dilute it enough to tolerate the saltiness.  The praises of this place come from the type of sushi you cannot find elsewhere.  I love the saba here, which is Mackerel.  Other places usually take the easy route and marinate it in the pickled ginger juice or their own vinegar marinade, but this place really serves the raw stuff.  Very good.  A must try in my book.  Sometimes Hana has monkfish liver, which is hard to find elsewhere.  It's better than uni (Sea urchin gonads) and literally the foie gras of the sea.  Very similar in texture and taste.  Mmmm... So good!!!Better than the average sushi bar, but a couple of things really rubbed me the wrong way and therefore brought my rating down to 3 stars.	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	3	2009-10-16	5	3

1	j1bCflLmKgXNayb6sVqpjQ	LXyNA5pK1rvE11wWEut_7g	"""Nice looking little place. We were promptly seated, but the service was a bit slow as the evening progressed. The diners who had brought their own beer/wine seemed to receive better service. All three of us ordered ice green tea and were surprised to receive cans instead of brewed. I honestly thought the waitress was surprised at us ordering it.We ordered a variety of items, including the salmon-covered california roll and the unagi nigiri. The sushi we had was very fresh, and I think the unagi was the most flavorful I've had. The rolls in general were a bit losely made, and the shrimp tempura roll was simply out of proportion: there was no way to eat a single piece without taking multiple bites, so it kind of ruined the concept of a """"roll"""".While nothing was bad per se, there wasn't really anything special that inspired me to want to return, and the prices were really high. I'd have rated it 4/5 if the prices had been more in line with other sushi restaurants.We didn't bother with deserts with Mary Coyle's Ice Cream Parlor being directly across the street."""

1	enG8kHKIscKC1b5PC47dvw	0h3p9x2-g-CI6d7H8bpnLQ	Yay for Hana!  I guess I'm a little late to find this place but thanks to my friend Brian who loves to try out new places as much as I do (next up, BreadFruit) we went to Hana today for lunch.  I was impressed.  After my less than stellar experience with Tottie's earlier this week I still had a major hankering for some raw fish...Hana to the rescue!I had no idea about the small space and the lunch rush but thankfully we got there right around noon and were able to walk right up to the sushi bar and sit down.  After being greeted by the amazing sushi chef (didn't get his name) we were brought drinks and we immediately started putting check marks next to all of the selections we wanted to try.  Within a minute, we were handed this interesting appetizer of a few tortilla chips with a yummy crab salad with a rice vinegar tasting base.  It reminded me of squid salad - either way, it was on the house and was very tasty.Our first roll came out very quickly and was followed by a bowl of pickled wasabi to try with the sushi.  I have eaten at MANY sushi restaurants, but have never been given this.  Yum!  Placed on top of the sushi it is very good, definitely try it.  We went through each of the rolls - the Alaska was very good, the salmon nigiri was amazing, literally so fresh it melted in my mouth.  The Vegas roll and the Dynamite roll were great as well.  As we are finishing, the sushi chef starts talking to us about Giant Clam.  Neither of us had seen a Giant clam before, so he pulled it out and starts showing us how it splashed you with salt water that comes out of its mouth.  I thought it was very interesting, I'm not sure if the lady next to me did because she got salt water on her.  My friend and I had to take a picture because it was unlike anything I'd ever seen but like something I have definitely seen, all at the same time.  Its a little scary, I'm not going to lie.  In fact, it looks slightly like something from a 70s porn movie.  That's just what I've heard, not that I've ever seen a 70s porn, I mean, what kind of a girl do you think I am? Gosh!  I took a picture on my phone so I will post it here for those of you who have never seen one.Overall, I had a good experience.  As someone said earlier, the food tastes so much better when the sushi chef is smiling and enjoying himself.It was just fast enough for a lunch hour, just enough food, and just enough fun.   However, it did get very busy after we arrived and there was a wait when we left.  I would recommend getting there early to avoid the rush.  Oh, and if you're adventurous, apparently that scary looking giant clam is delicious when sauteed :)  I will let one of you try it first and let me know what you think.  I'm not that brave yet.

0	a9ngFybJ_J0rVcxgCZ3tKQ	aaZXwuIY09_QeBKhc4w-Ww	Based on all the yelp reviews, my Mesa friend and I came here for dinner tonight.  It was a fantastic choice.  Our waiter was super nice and super quick.  The atmosphere was dim and cozy.  Definitely would not recommend this for a big group though, it would be a bit cramped.  Here's what we ordered:1.) Ika Kara Age (Sweet butter marinated squid breaded to a crunchy finish)  -  This dish was DELICIOUS, the squid was cooked just right! It wasn't chewy, rubbery or overcooked. It was tender, just enough flavor ...and many pieces in one order!2.)  Agadashi Tofu (Lightly cooked tofu served in tempura sauce with bonito)  -  This dish was a little bland, you'd think that since tofu doesn't have much flavor...the majority of the flavor would be in the sauce. But no.  We had to sprinkle salt into the sauce ..which then made it better.3.)  Umi No Sachi  (A sashimi salad)  -  A bed of mixed greens, HUGE chunks of sashimi all drizzled with a creamy white sauce.  This was the highlight of our dinner. I've never seen a sashimi salad for $16 that had this much sashimi that was so fresh, cut into such big slices before.  I absolutely give this dish 5stars!!!!!!!  You HAVE TO try this.4.) Alaskan Roll -  A california roll wrapped with raw salmon.  You think, what's so special right? There must have been a secret sauce they put inside this roll because you got this amazing after taste...that just made you want to take another piece and another piece....and another piece...5.)  Philadelphia Roll  -  A roll with cream cheese and salmon.  This was average, nothing significant but i was happy.6.) Spicy Tuna Roll -  REALLY good spicy tuna roll, made me regret not ordering a spicy tuna hand roll....i bet that would have been orgasmic.  All the more reason to revisit!!    :)	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	4	2010-05-28	0	0

My total was 87 dollars! Yes 87 dollars! I lived in LA for 10 years that is Nobu prices, this is Phx, lol really! This when you know a place thinks it's way better and bigger than it is they lose their way. I actually had to ask the prices to make sure because I was so dumbfounded.

Also, their sushi has properly done rice, which is hard to find in AZ. Everything else I've tried on the menu has been excellent, the soba and tempura stand out in particular. The service here is always really friendly. The only thing I wish Hana had was slightly more space inside. All around a great place for sushi and Japanese!	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	5	2014-03-09	2	1

But, My girlfriend had been here before and really liked it.So we give it a try then.It is located in a shopping center,right on the end. There is a decent amount of parking. The fun thing is you can bring your own booze in. Either beer or wine.You do not see that in many places, so I like it.The food is really fresh and quite good. I am not a huge fan of healthy food, but I will do it for T's sake.I do like it here though, not too bad at all. It is a bit small in here. So it can get crowded fast. It is clean ,and the staff is fun and nice.	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	4	2014-04-01	7	6

My Calamari looked like a little squid was so fresh and tender it nearly melted in my mouth.The menu has a lot to offer for non-sushi lovers, too.The service was great, four servers despite the place being small and having only about 10 or 12 tables.Highly recommended!

The only complaint I would have is for some people that finish their food but take up a table after they have finished their meal.  The restaurant is a bit on the small side so you have to wait a little longer if a group wants to take a couple of hours to finish up the bottle of wine they brought with them.

0	1OY4TL0THUmrJArsvwjYYQ	UBoiDuDgP9upsVslyZ1y_Q	this is the quintessential place to enjoy the finest, freshest sushi in the valley, though you will be paying for it. i live very close to hana and find myself going there at least once or twice a week. they have the usual assortment of sushi rolls, of course, but their specials on the board, are what you want to inquire about. i have had lobster rolls, not to be confused with what you would find in new england...and kobi beef, which melted in my mouth.  the hamachi is delicious and their salads are a great value, fresh greens and slices of silky salmon, yellow tail, ahi and white fish. their baked clams are cooked to perfection. since i live right around the corner, i have only dined in on two occassions, and both times the wait staff was on top of things. and were able to answer questions about some of the more obscure offerings. it's a small place, but not claustrophic. there is a tv, but i never notice anyone watching it, they are so consumed with the food.  i highly recommend hana.

This place hands down won our vote for amazing service and very authentic and tasty sushi! We never had to wait longer than a few minutes for service even though they were packed.

0	xwXw5HW3Y6Gr37V0KxX8sA	Uk4aOl8ISG6eevrt49gAQg	Yesterday I was seeking out a sushi bar in our quest to locate the best sushi in Phoenix, and this place looked promising.  They had chefs who will make something interesting for you, and that is what I really like in a good sushi restaurant.When we walked in and looked at the menu, it looked decent.  They had ankimo, so of course we got that.  We also ordered some scallops, red snapper, spanish mackerel with deep-fried body, a baked salmon roll, some uni shooters, the carpaccio, and we also told them to just make us something interesting.We started out with miso soup.  It was pretty typical.The carpaccio set the tone for the rest of the meal - on paper, stips of red snapper, tuna, yellowtail, and salmon with a cucumber garnish and fresh wasabi should be awesome.  But it was missing something.  It was kind of bland.  The carpaccio we had last week was one of the highlights; this time it was boring.If you have read any of my other recent sushi reviews, you'd know that one of my new favorite dishes is ankimo (or steamed monkfish liver).  The ankimo they served us happens to be the first ankimo I didn't like.  For some reason it tasted bland, and it was even a different color and texture than other ankimo I had.  I suspect this was overcooked.  They also brought us the ankimo sliders for good measure (hopefully they didn't charge us for this, because we didn't ask for it), and they were decent, but not mind-blowing.  The waitress told us people usually bite the lemon it is served on in order to balance it out; my friend tried that and said it totally ruined it.  Makes sense, as the slider has a lot of delicate flavors, and lemon is not delicate at all.The sushi (red snapper, scallop, Spanish mackerel) was pretty typical.  I did like the deep fried Spanish mackerel body.  The fish itself had very little meat, though.  I've had Spanish mackerel with twice as much meat (see: Yama Sushi in Portland).The baked salmon roll was a terrible idea.  I knew the idea of a cooked roll would not really appeal to me... But I was open to it.  I like to let other people order things they want, too, you know... But neither of us cared for it.  We think it actually had cheese on it.  Yes, cheese, on a seafood dish.  I would totally back legislation that made combining fish and yellow cheeses illegal.The uni shooters epitomized this place.  It was an idea that sounded really, really awesome on paper, but was poorly executed.  You see, the uni shooter contains an oyster, a piece of uni, and a raw quail egg.  Sounds awesome, right?  Of course it does.  But it also had a sauce that was so strong that it completely masked the flavor of the things I actually wanted to taste.  The oyster could still be noticed, but the quail egg was barely detectable, and the uni might as well have been left out.  Uni is delicate, and should not be served with strong flavors.  Without the sauce, it would've been perfect.I actually enjoyed the special item the chef made us.  It was described to us (by who I believe may have been the owner) as a Japanese comfort food.  Basically, it was a small stew/soup thing with eggs, uni, and a couple other things in it.  It really was unique, and I haven't had anything else quite like it.Finally, the dessert menu contained one item I got really excited about: tempura ice cream.  It has been about nine years since I had the dish in Kingston, NY, so, of course, I had to order it.  Unfortunately, instead of one big scoop of ice cream, it was served in three small scoops, so all but a little ball of ice cream from each scoop was melted.  It was basically tempura soaked in cream.  Again, great idea, poor execution.This is a place I want to like, because the owner does have some creativity, and probably cares about the cuisine.  It's definitely not generic, and that's definitely worth something.  But compared to the meal we had last week, it paled in comparison.  It was inferior in every single respect, and our bill was actually larger!  In Phoenix, you can't charge $90/person after tip and expect repeat business, unless the entire experience is spectacular.  Because there are places that provide that at that price point.	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	3	2012-11-01	0	0

One of them really wanted sushi and I've been wanting to try this place, so we thought we give it a try. We all got sushi, I got a little bit ahead of myself and got a Hana Bento Lunchbox. The sushi was great, we were the first ones there when it opened so we got our food fairly quickly. The place did get busy as lunch time rolled around. I didn't give this place 5 stars because when it was time to pay our checks they told us that we were each going to be charged an extra $1.50 for a split charge fee. That kind of pissed me off because how hard is it to really split a check? And why wouldn't you do it for free knowing that you're located by office buildings? I just don't understand the fee and because of this none of us are willing to go back now.	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	3	2013-07-02	2	2

Hubby and I went out for dinner recently and were told by the host that the two open tables were now being reserved for walk-ins of parties of 4 only because, """"we make more money off them."""" That's exactly what he said. He told us that something at the sushi bar was sure to open up soon. Thirty minutes later and still waiting, we now had a growing crowd of two's on the wait list. A party of three walked in and were seated IMMEDIATELY. We should have walked out right then, but we were so hungry we figured it couldn't be much longer. Wrong. We waited another 20 minutes until a table finally opened up. Meanwhile, the table for four remained empty. This is a BAD policy. Seating should be first-come, first-served.

I've lived in Japan for several months while studying there and have been back numerous times, so I can have high standards for Japanese food. I understand standards are lower here in Phoenix, but still I've had far better at other non-Japanese restaurants here in the Valley. We first arrived and we're greeted by a nice waitress. She took our drink orders and told us about the specials. """"Car-agee chicken"""" """"What?!"""" I'm not a Japanese language snob, but if you work in a Japanese restaurant that claims to sell Japanese food, at least learn the proper pronunciation of the dishes. It's """"kah-rha-ah-geh chicken"""" Next came the food. My dad order the Tai special at the suggestion of the waitress. Should've known better judging by her knowledge of Japanese food. It was 4 small pieces of over-cooked fish for $23. What a rip! My food was mediocre at best. The sushi rice was plain-- no rice wine vinegar as is customary for properly flavored sushi rice.

A few special rolls we tried were on point.  Our server did a okay job. The missing star is lack of being seated fur 10-15 minutes even tho have the tables were open.  We finally gave up and sat at the sushi bar rather than continuing to wait.  The chefs did not communicate or check in with us. The good food was worth the inconvenience.

1	9wpNzN8NN8Qx3KgL7jjMIg	koYrKIRejEFZM93PrXYheA	"""I haven't been to Hana's since it first opened. So its been quite a few years. As I made my return I slowly remembered why I haven't been to Hana's in... well, quite a few years. I'm happy for them in one aspect because it looks like they have come a long way as far as the amount of diners are concerned. The pricing on the other hand is just ridiculous. Way overpriced for a small neighborhood operation. (And then again maybe that's why it is that way) That is just my opinion. Or at least compared to the major players I frequent. These are a couple of my favs. RA, Sapporo, Stingray, Sushi Broker's...even Kona Grill is gettin' some love. Okay, so right off the bat I notice I have an appetizer of some sort made with Surimi (fish paste aka fake crab or krab) on some sort of fried dumpling chip (like a crab rangoon). I'm okay with that. What I'm not okay with is when some sushi restaurants make that the basis of many of their dishes. (i.e. the old Mr. Sushi located at Northern and I-17) So, basically their Surimi concoction is inside of every roll or in, on or alongside any other dish you may order. Okay, so back to the pricing. Now my thought is if you're going to have these """"unusual"""" prices, please don't wave the former lower prices in my face by simply crossing them out on the menu in magic marker where I can still see them and replace them with higher prices. Just get a new menu. I'm cool with that. That's like going to the store to see a cool shirt you want to buy and you realize that it's 20 dollars but the  tag underneath says it was 10 dollars...now that's a bummer.So, I end up ordering a Rainbow Roll (One of my staple sushi meals. You can't mess that up right?) that is close to 16 dollars. (Of course I have to look at the previous price of 10 dollars that is crossed out...bummer) I also order a Scallop Dynamite (which is one of my favorites at RA, so let's give it a try here.) That was up there in price too. I think it was close to 14 or 15 dollars as well. Anyway, both were disappointing. The Rainbow Roll had no shrimp on it and was filled with my favorite yummy Surimi concoction. (That's me being facetious) The Scallop Dynamite came out in some aluminum foil that was hand shaped to form a shallow dish. (I'm assuming it was prepared in this) Not only was that presentation ghetto fabulous it was primarily made of...you guessed it! Yummy Surimi Concoction! (That's me being facetious again) So, with these two items and a canned green tea my total was $36 and some odd cents not including the tip. So, after I was helped off of the barrel and untied, I calmly pulled my pants back up, removed the ball gag from my mouth and walked out to my vehicle and left. The entire drive I was seething to get back and write this very review.Although I must add that the staff was friendly and attentive. If I could give a 2.5 I would. I just can't bring myself to do a 3 in this situation.Good luck Hana Japanese Eatery!"""	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	2	2015-02-11	1	0

The service was phenomenal & they accommodated my boyfriend's shellfish allergy better than any restaurant we've ever gone to! They really went above and beyond. So I'm Japanese from Hawaii & really miss Japanese food when I'm in Arizona. I have found a few places that have been okay, but so far Hana is the best Japanese I've had in Phoenix! A little on the pricey side, this has the best actual Japanese food (not just sushi). Previously I said Hiro Sushi, but for Japanese food other than sushi - Hana has taken the crown. We tried the shrimp & veg tempura, chicken tatsuuaage (karaage), a philly roll (no shellfish :P), ahi, gyu tan bowl (sukiyaki), mochi, and probably some more that I forgot. Everything was good and here's where I was really impressed - normally because places fry everything in the same fryer, if you have a shellfish allergy you can't eat ANYTHING fried. However, Hana was so accommodating and made it possible for my boyfriend to finally try tempura (their's is very light!). They really accommodated us --- thank you for great service! A few things were a little overcooked/I wouldn't order again, but their tempura & sukiyaki were both 10/10!!! Can't wait to return here & I definitely will be soon!

Nothing exotic, just pretty good fish, which is difficult enough to find in Phoenix.-The uni was a little sweet, but at this point in the year, it should be sweet and melting- The maguro was better than average.  It had a little bit of a bite, which is what I look for- The aji was very nice- The hamachi was buttery and the best fish of the night- The unagi was better than average- The albacore was average- The suzuki was delicious- The halibut was light and a nice way to start- The Hana roll was ok.  Nothing exciting- The gyoza were not good- Service was friendly, but a little slowIf I'm in the area and jonesing for sushi, I'll go.	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	3	2014-01-18	3	0

The rolls were very good and the fish tasted very fresh. The tuna rolls are $8, California rolls around $7 and various specialty rolls for $11-$12. They will also make the rolls to your own spiciness liking.  On the fun side, the rolls are served on a wooden boat with a flaming sugar cube!  The place is small and i can see how it could be quite noisy in there if it is busy. They charge $1.50 fee per credit card if you want to pay with more then 1 card.

It  is close to our home in the Biltmore Area and we have always enjoyed the food - which is fresh, innovative, and unique...  However, we have had the same issue regarding customer service (seating policy) numerous times during our visits - and in our last visit on Thursday, it actually compelled us to finally walk out..... Almost of all our visits were just made up of my wife and I (party of two) and I think the strict seating policy of not ever giving a table of four to a party of two is ridiculous.  Now, I completely understand the desire to reserve larger tables for larger parties - I actually worked in several restaurants in my pre-professional phase of life in high school and college - but to blindly apply it across all circumstances like - in our case - when there is no one else waiting in the later part of the evening on a Thursday night is short-sighted and just plain dumb.  Here was our scenario:- We arrive around 7:30pm - one table available with four empty seats, and we are informed """"I'm sorry, we have to keep that open for larger parties.."""" Larger, really?  A party of four does not exactly make a massive celebration...- We agree to wait to see if something else opens up.- While toting a very nice bottle of chilled white wine from home, we continue to wait.  No one comes by with an offer of glasses, a wine chiller, nothing.....  20 minutes goes by...  If you are going to stick with a goofy policy like this - at least make the effort to keep people happy.  How hard would it be to bring glasses, and ice bucket, and maybe even take an order for an appetizer??  Again, nothing ....- It's now almost 1/2 hour of waiting - close to 8pm - no one has left the restaurant nor has anyone come in either..  The empty table of four remains empty not earning the restaurant a dime in revenues or (most shockingly) the goodwill of a customer who really does want to patronize you...- Finally, a party of three shows up - that's three, not four...  Of course, they are seated immediately while we continue to wait. - At that point, I tell the person seating guests that we're leaving and we walk out... At this point, I'm done.  The service received was not only inept - but basically rude as well.  My recommendation: don't even consider this place if you are a couple looking for a nice dinner out.  I will not be back unless someone takes an active interest in fixing this issue going forward.  Plenty of other choices in the Camelback Corridor where one does not have to put up with that BS..."""

Their spicy tuna is the best I've ever had. Give me that, the shrimp tempura roll, and I'm set! My husband always likes starting off with the edamame, but here's a head's up - If you like your edamame warm, ask them to heat it. Otherwise they will serve it cold, which is apparently the traditional (unAmericanized) way to eat it. Hana is byob and they don't charge an uncorking fee. This is truly unbelievable to me and I hope they don't change that policy any time soon. This makes date night SUPER affordable in addition to being yummy! The only downside is dependent on the crowd. If it's busy and you happen to go when there are larger parties, it can get really loud. If there aren't lot of larger parties, it's no louder than any other restaurant. Otherwise, the decor and simple, the ambiance is relaxed, and it's got a great vibe.

5	kc-rnN-ndnFTdHG4TfIgeQ	IMGMeUiadh0Ku1p-aajBJg	"""There are so many things *right* with Hana that one can almost overlook the sordid quality and schmaltzy presentation of their sushi rolls.Overriding every other concept of the restaurant is the fact that 95% of the hungry patrons at Hana are boozehounds like myself, and this place will cater to the unholy amounts of BYOB that each table will bring.  What is truly exceptional is that 1) No corkage fee 2) They will chill your white for you in an ice bucket at the table 3) If you bring beer, they will keep it in their fridge for you and bring you another as you continue to dine  4) everyone here relishes in this policy.Seriously, I witnessed a table of 5 with 5 bottles of wine and a sixer of some imported swill.  You could eat a seaweed wrapped piece of Gypsy at this saturation point, and it would taste like toro.So, my gf Melissa B and I get there around 6:30 on a Saturday loaded up with our Sav Blanc and six of Rogue Dead Guy Ale and with full intentions of waiting for a table due to the popularity of this restaurant and its 50 person max capacity.  Surprisingly, they had 3 tables open, all of them 4-tops.  The hostess informs us that the wait will be 20-25 mins and I'm thinking 'oh, cool, those tables must be reserved.  No worries.  Oh, and hey look!  There is a two top paying out'.  Well, after that couple leaves, they scoot over the two top to make it a six top and seat the aforementioned boozer-quintuplets who were rightfully there before us still waiting.  Okay.  No biggie, there are still open tables.A party of three come in.  """"Hi!  There is no waiting"""".  They get a seatAnother party of three stroll in.  Yep.  """"Hi!  There is no waiting"""".  There goes our last chance of a seat for a while, and we're 25 mins into our wait.  Thank God I brought the beer.As I understand it, they will only seat parties of two at their two tops [of which they had few, and one was being used as an impromptu wine rack for the wino-Salingers] or at the sushi bar.  I really have absolutely no problem with this policy, but I could see how it would piss some people off -- maybe from an older generation who feel slighted by shit like this, which is why I'm even discussing it.  But anyway, we eventually we got our perfect little two top and preceded to order edamame and miso.  These are two staple appetizers for any Japanese restaurant.  The edamame came out cold, which was okay, as it is typically served cooled .. but I actually prefer my edamame heated and the server never asked for a preference ... hell, they even ask you at throw-away joints like Ra.  Since we are a culture of benevolent Americans who are intent on skewing EVERY foreign dish, I always assume that the edamame will be served warm.  Either way, I was too timid to ask since these servers seem to be flying around the small restaurant with nary a second to spare at the microwave.  The miso soup was excellent ... but if I'm looking for shit to complain about, they served it with that damn goofy, oversized spoon.When we got our boat of fish my gf and I commented that we would have liked a little extra prep time.  I mean come on, there needs to be distinct transitional times between courses.  We were only mildly impressed with the presentation.  The rolls were prepped very sloppily.  The yellowtail was absolutely lost in the rice.  The tempura shrimp was sliced so thin that it was destroyed by the chopstick.  The caterpillar roll had almost no essence of eel within.  The spicy tuna was good, but nothing to rave about as seems to be the trend when discussing Hana.  We also ordered the processed daikon off of their specials-board [which our server never went over BTW], and I would highly recommend staying away from this unless you curiously want to know what Little Lisa's Slurry from the Simpson's episode """"The Old Man and The Lisa"""" might have tasted like.  Blech.  I'm sure it was downhome authentic, but Christ, THAT was vile.  Anyway, that was MY fault, not Hana's.I will say that the first time that I came to Hana [with Graham C and Yelp's famous Jerry], it was absolutely phenomenal.  I think something has been lost in translation.  Back then, their rolls were much better prepared and the toro was otherworldly.  Perhaps it is the hulking Melrose virulence seeping into their foundation.I will conclude with a statement about  how I am aware that Hana is going for authenticity; which makes the curt service, lack of formalities like """"hi! how is everyone today"""" [I doubt they do that shit at sushi joints in Japan], and loud, bustling atmosphere work to a degree.  I can HOWEVER, see that being such a turn-off to those unwilling or unaware to put up with it, or worse yet, interpret it as rudeness.  I personally like the fact that places like Hana exist as an antithesis to garbage like Ra.  But every polarization needs an equilibrium, and for my money, time, and need for experience, nothing beats Sakana."""	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	3	2008-05-18	6	3
0	JM9ZZ5-0ab-kjaJicKedOg	P_SBQk8dtATQIwW4P-YcWA	This place is very close to my house, so, I eat here regularly. It's always fresh good cuts of sushi/sashimi. My personal favs are: salmon, yellowtail, mackeral, tamago, and freshwater eel. I also love the rainbow carpaccio and Hana salad (tons of avocado, parmesan, and sunflower seeds-YUM). I only wish they would add inari to the menu. Remember to bring your own alcohol because they don't have it. Otherwise you'll be stuck with green tea instead of sake like me (I always forget). Also, be prepared to wait as this place is quite small and always packed at dinner time.	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	5	2011-09-07	2	0

Docked a star since my friend waited 30 minutes (no joke) for her spider roll (something that shouldn't have taken that long to prep). My other friend & I got ours in a timely fashion, especially given how busy they were. Kind of a cozy/low-key place-limited seating. I would happily return there again!

0	rtV9sxOl8dbmsE31rj5DpQ	pW19oeywaDbtdVau_xAK1g	I took my lady here since she's never been here before. She has a thing for sashimi so I figured this place was pretty good...well reviewed and semi-upscale. The place is small...we had to wait standing in line for about an hour and a half. I wish it was shorter or we could've made a reservation but with the way women get ready...I didn't know if I was going to arrive within 10 minutes of my reservation or 10 days (let's be honest here). I then asked and I think I recollect that they don't take reservations.The parking is somewhat tight when it's night time. Apparently, this is where they get the most business. However, I guess you can always park in the neighborhood streets just a few feet away. It's BYOB. You can bring your own alcohol. I wish I would've brought Moscato but we didn't know until I asked. Our waitress service was slow, but we sat up front and the Sushi Master was a old Japanese guy...quite nice guy. He attended to us very well. Their prices are a little higher than what I'm accustomed to from eating at places like Saki Bomber's or Kabuki but I like watching the food being made in front of me.I would say the food is very fresh but let's face it...the coast is in California and we all know about the drive from there. However, the food was still very delicious. We also bought some of the soup noodle to go. That was very delicious still when we got hungry later on.They had this very cool menu item I think where they bring you a wooden boat with fire and sushi on it. I came back a few days later with a friend and ordered it. Very good.Overall, I thought this place was a very nice date night place. The wait sucks but  it's worth it. We came out full and with a few takeout boxes.	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	4	2013-11-19	0	0
0	oyJDfU9WqofhOnwyUVyvoQ	HRUu4IcEkZa2jon5CCaQdg	One of THE BEST Japanese restaurants in town!  (My other choice is the Hiro Sushi in Scottsdale)I've been here several times and always had the most delicious foods!  I usually order sushi and several items from the 'special' menu on the wall.  The fish is so tasty, raw or cooked!  Also, the rice is really good here. (I know, it's silly but it's really key to a good Japanese meal to me :))  The menu consists of variety of Japanese comfort foods too so you can try different types of Japanese food other than Sushi and Sashimi.I love the BYOB so you can bring your own alcoholic drink, if you so desire.  They'll keep the bottles chilled and serve it to you when you want to refresh your drink.  I believe they'd also warm up your sake if you like it hot.The inside is quite small so if you don't want to wait - for dinner -  (there's not much of a waiting area either) I suggest to get there right when they open :)If you like Japanese food, this is the place to go :)Arigatou!

The sushi is always top notch and ever since my husband and first dined at that sushi bar, we haven't been to any other japanese restaurant.  Why would we??  We get ridiculously excited when we find someone who hasn't heard of Hana's (getting tougher since it's fame isn't so hidden) and we quickly take them out!BYOB is awesome!  I'd say it helps us save a little bit of cash, but that extra cash just ends up being spent on more SUSHI!  That or the great staff!  Anywhere else I my """"complain"""" about the minimum seating, but here it makes you feel like you are in a dear friends dining room.  During our 1 year anniversary dinner we splurged big time and now I am ADDICTED to the Hana Pride roll.  It's everything good in this world all on one plate.

0	JAs3HUu6w13nOXTp2ofkxA	NToGEfvqHttBuDOn53SDyA	Food was on pricey side for their dinners especially for a place that small and no liquor license.   I eat at many Asian restaurants and never pay that much anywhere.Too noisy.  I was there yesterday with a group and we could not hold a conversation due to the noise.  Even trying to hear the person next to you at times was difficult.Not well organized. Waiter just plunked all our checks in middle of table and we had to figure out who they belonged to.  Checks were handwritten and confusing.  Made a $2 error in their favor on my check which I called to their attention.  I also did notice that when they include the gratuity they are basing it on the total which includes the tax.  This is not right. It is not the amount it is the principle.e noise.  I opted for an appetizer of sliced pork in order to avoid the fried as well as the high carb foods.  This was just average in taste.They do not take reservations but this could be due to the size and number of tables.  Would not recommend for groups over 4.	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	3	2013-07-01	0	0

This is coming from someone who lived in Japan for four years and tried really hard to get mercury poisoning while there.  Hana's reminds me of all the great sushi places on the shore in Japan.  It is not fancy and does not need to be because they put their money into the food and you can taste it.  Their chefs are absolutely amazing and create not only amazing sushi but also great dishes.The service is just as good as the food.

The top layer of white fish, with the spicy sauce, and the added characteristic of it being baked, made for what is my new favorite dish.I will definitely be returning.

2	ctXFXk9-m6PCMoI-Nz2_XQ	5Mh7J0UK4i3VnNllkeoy3g	Hana holds a special place in my heart as it was one of the first Japanese place I've eaten here in Arizona!I've been here multiple times for their sushi and yes, yes, yes hands down really good quality sushi/sashimi and they do BYOB- uhm what? Yes, come here.I decided to do something different for a change and try their ramen- I've been in all sorts of Asian food withdrawals so yeah, ramen it was. I ordered the Tonkotsu broth ramen and an order of Salmon Nigiri, because the quality of their fish here is on point. The waitress was nice enough to confirm and even offer me an egg of which I quickly agreed, until I questioned what kind - a chicken egg, she replies ... uhm not exactly what I was asking. She later responds, oh soft boiled! She was so cute! Hahaha. Soft boiled eggs are my weakness, FYI. The tonkotsu broth was milky, good chewy noodles and fairly large in portion, the charshu was thick but oh-so tender and the soft boiled egg was perfect. It comes with menma, scallions, wakame and naruto garnish the top which are good flavor accents to the bowl of ramen.The service here is good, love the dim and intimate atmosphere. Rick is always smiling and observant of his customers! I always feel welcomed and appreciated when coming here.The total bill for the ramen and two pieces of nigiri came out to be around $18-20 with tip, which is a bit pricey for just ramen. However, it's pretty good in comparison than other ramen I've had here in Phoenix and the quality of the food and service here is downright great.	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	4	2015-02-02	4	1

0	PBSk4cQN8gA8ysKFz32PLA	TfbsgrK50FvhExJApW704g	"""Took my dad here when he was in town.  He is a traditional Japanese eater so no bistros or fancy sushi for him!  We don't live close to this neighborhood at all but we were in the hood and asked around about a Japanese restaurant close by.  Hana was recommended to us as a good but a little on the pricey side place to eat.  They were correct. It was almost hard to find a spot to park.  The restaurant is very tiny and it was very packed.  They told us 20 minutes for a table, but we only waited about 5.  The hostess was very nice and polite.  The service was quick and to my dad's excitement, our server was Asian.  (he has this weird thing about not eating at an Asian restaurant unless some of the servers/chefs are Asian - says it's a sign of """"Americanization of the food"""").  The ambiance was welcoming but yet had that urban feel to it.  All the employees seemed extremely nice and polite and there were some large parties waiting for tables for over 40 minutes.  There's something to be said about the restaurant if these people were willing to wait that long with children.  We ordered the usual stuff, edamame, soup, salad, sushi, etc.  The edamame came out cold - never had cold before.  When my dad asked them if we could get hot ones they nuked the ones we had, making them a little soggy.  All the food was good, not exceptional.  The reason for 3 stars is it's quite pricey for the quality and for what we had.  We have a Japanese restaurant in our hood that serves the same quality food for less.  Of course, there are no Asian people working there so Dad's out...  Overall, if I was in the area again, I might stop by to try some other items on the menu but I wouldn't go out of my way to stop again.  If you are in the area, it's definitely worth a try."""

They are small and cosy, but very friendly and helpful.Admittedly, the first time I went I was a tad bit underwhelmed with the service, as the girl was efficient but very reserved. Feels strange after the chattiness of most wait staff! But the fish was excellent so we went back, and really, they are all lovely, just not as effusive as usual. Best feature of all is the BYO - bring beer or wine and they will provide the cups and keep your bottles in the fridge. No charge!The Rainbow Carpaccio is sublime, the sashimi is always fresh, and most importantly, they have fresh wasabi. Now fresh wasabi is a new experience for me, but it is so far beyond the standard wasabi paste, it will knock your socks off. I am now seriously disappointed when I go to an upscale sushi restaurant and they do not have it.I've moved now, and have not managed to find anything as good.

The Hamachi Kama was a highlight, but might have been a bit over cooked. The tuna sashimi was chewy and rough. Ew!

I personally had no expectations and Hana still missed them. Before seating us at a LARGE table (there's maybe 10 tables in this joint), this obviously inexperienced hostess first looked unsure of where she should seat us (the table for 2 or for 4?) She then proceeded to rearrange the table for 4, and moved ALL of the chairs around the table to add 1, instead of just adding it to the empty space on the end of the table.... odd.And then our waitress.... was really abrupt and ungracious about things. My sister's accompanying salad was half covered in lettuce rust - and when she showed the waitress, all she said was """"so do you want it?"""" Uhm, no thank you, I like my food fresh, not rotten, but thanks.The sushi was pretty much the same thing covered in different sauces. Annnd they were pricey. it was kinda sorta really unbelievably ridiculous. RIDICULOUS, i tell you! Not worth it. No way. I'm quite sure that the """"crab"""" was imitation. And the fish wasn't even that fresh. Granted, we're in the middle of a desert, but still. The one redeeming quality of this place? The ramen. Although there were about 10 noodles in it, the pork was perfectly cooked. And it would have been nice if the chef had been a little less stingy with the ramen noodles. Would I come back?

The fish is not especially fresh or attractive, the rice is hard and not all that tasty, the service is chaotic. I want to like this place. I really do. But it's not nearly as good as Harumi or Yasu or Hiro. The bright points were the green tea (best I've had in a long time) and the spicy tuna roll, which was very good. But the salmon skin hand roll was a disaster. Nothing about it was good. Instead of crispy salmon skin you get what I'll call salmon scrapings, meaty, but not in a good way. And there are these strong-tasting vegetables in there that are totally out of place and quite sad. The nigiri was kind of okay. Nothing at all special about the proteins, and the rice balls are dense and hard without that tangy vinegar flavor I expect. I've had bad tamago maybe once before in my life, and this tamago was maybe the worst. Ice cold, falling apart, and just not the right flavor. The eel was rather disappointing too, and I rarely feel that way about eel anywhere. The best protein was probably the scallop, but that isn't saying much. Salmon was disappointing too. Especially after the sensational salmon we've enjoyed at Hiro the last couple of visits. Our server was enthusiastic and pleasant, but everything came at the wrong time. Our so-so tempura appetizer came out about 10 minutes after the sushi, and the soups we ordered never came at all. At least they didn't try to charge us for them. I won't be back. There's much better sushi to be had nearby.	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	2	2015-12-28	0	0

There fish must be caught in Garanda Parks lakes thats how fresh it seems (I know horrible reference but they have great fish) and the statement BYOB is bob spelled with a y and who doesn't like bob (which will save you cash money son, plus there is something liberating about drinking 40's in public). So if you want to have ultra fresh sushi without all the garbage glam that most sushi places throw in your face, while drinking some steel reserve with a date who you are trying to convince that you once lived a normal life, than this place is perfect for you yo.

2	PGvNJ-5-IBDxEZL33maCcQ	kk7IILM5XsbAYbwz7LbQaQ	Hurry up and Leave!This was our third visit to Hana because the food is excellent. God forbid you walk in at 8:40pm, 20 minutes until posted hours of closing time. Might as well post closing at 8:30pm as both service and quality decline closer to closing!!!Fist two visits went extremely well and so why not try it a third, right?!?! NO! It was CLEAR by the hostesses reaction that we were not welcome at 840pm as she rolled her eyes and quickly walked away from us. Not a good first impression but we were confident in the food and decided to give it a go. We had a nice bottle of wine and were expecting a wonderful date night and the typical HANA experience... DENIED!We were in and out in less than 40 minutes, $75 for two of us (without tip), not including our bottle of wine we shared one glass of. We found ourselves shoveling food in our faces as the servers were doing all of their side work surrounding us. Very uncomfortable dining experience and disappointing. I'm not one to post and especially not with a negative review and I WILL go back (before 8pm), but I do believe the owners and future guest should be aware of this situation. Last time I checked if your posted hours are until 9pm, you serve food until 9pm???? Right? Not everyone out by 9pm! Not to mention with your price point, guest are visiting your establishment to enjoy their dinning experience and not be rushed! We ended up going to Sochu House for a couple other dishes as we did not get enough to eat and Lord knows my man needs his dessert. Hopefully, next visit will be earlier and better. Know that you have been warned, and enjoy Hana, but go early!!!!!	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	2	2013-05-15	1	0

The Hana Japanese Eatery not only has very wonderfully prepared and presented dishes, they also have impeccable service; which again made our dining experience fantastic. I had Yasi Yaki Udon. My mom had Tori Kara Age, and I had another noodle dish that I'm afraid I can't pronounce. For appetizers we had cubed tofu, and Tempura vegetables. The Jolly Diners rated the Hana Japanese Eatery at a 5 out of 5. It was busy,  and Beyer than the first time. They have plenty of sushi, dishes without animal products, and others with chicken and pork. We recommend this restaurant for people who appreciate well prepared, good food.

0	kxONbQfAjbODEiAK1XSe8w	1rZUPRCxu3WQyOqEE5f2Zw	The sushi was fresh and excellent! The service was almost too fast. I did not find the prices to be out of line with the quality.  Our daughter loved the miso soup. The one thing I really appreciated is that they will make what you want, whether it is on the menu or not. If they have it, you can get it. I know we'll be going there often. One thing though, this is a busy, noisy place. It is not large either. If you are looking for quite and relaxed, this perhaps isn't the best choice. If you want good food in a noisy cheerful atmosphere, like a bunch of friends or after work, this fits the bill.	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	5	2010-08-28	0	0
0	dPlQNoY-rWL1DLh3UqldNQ	HzHPToXTV_MMJxj-Vm1uxA	First off... this place should have $$$ instead of just two. If you're going to eat just sushi, you'll love this place. They have amazing rolls and sashimi (I don't like fish and I still enjoyed the Spicy Tuna)! I also ordered the Ramen and it had an unpleasant barnyard flavor that I'm not sure was supposed to be there, but was unwelcome. I was glad that everybody else was almost done eating when it came out because I would hate to be the one who ruined everybody else's otherwise pleasant dining experience. If you're looking for a romantic night out, this is not the place to go. It's so loud, you'll be yelling at each other and repeating yourself all night.	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	4	2015-09-10	0	0
0	YpMhF6ZXWIEo2Vji6NGLeA	30BvKZX4nqsSzoQ6FN6ZpA	I love Hana!  I really wish I had gone there tonight instead of Moto, which is horrible. But anyway, back to Hana.  I've been there quite a few times.  It's best to go early--around 5:30, right when they open.  When I've gotten there around 5:30-5:45, I haven't had to wait in line.  Otherwise, it gets pretty packed and you'll probably end up waiting. Everything I've ever had here is good.  Salmon nigiri is my favorite, and theirs is delicious.  The salmon is so buttery and flavorful, and not nasty and fishy tasting like at some places.  They put pieces of lemon on each piece of fish, which makes the flavor come out in a delightful way. Every roll I've had has been delicious.  I really like the shrimp tempura roll, and the Hana roll (which is similar) is also good.  Those are the two rolls I've had there most recently. They also do takeout--so I get takeout sushi here when I'm stressed from work and feel like splurging.  It's always worth it.  Their squid salad is also delish, and so is the pork gyoza. As for the service, it's always been great every time I've been there.  We've had the same waiter the past few times--not sure of his name, but he's kind of hipstery and has dark hair.  He's always very friendly and helpful.  Good to know--it's BYOB.  But I had a problem once--I brought a Jack Daniels brand malt liquor beverage--similar to a Smirnoff Ice or something.  I guess the owner thought it was pink whiskey, because they wouldn't let us drink it.  But, they're cool with beer & wine.  The waiter said he'd look into drinks like the ones I brought to find out if they're ok under the liquor license that the restaurant has, so I'm not sure if that rule has changed or not.  I definitely recommend Hana.  I plan to go back again ASAP.	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	5	2009-10-03	0	0

Walked in, jammed, figured it would be a long wait......surprise, within 15 minutes we were at the counter - which was an awesome place to luck into sitting.Our waitperson, Carol - outstanding!! - guided us through the extensive menu......as usual when we're new to somewhere, we over-order.....but oh so good.  Sushi was killer - best I've had since Honolulu. Love the BYOB - our Chardonnay was a tad warmish by the time we got seated, but staff brought over an ice bucket (classy!).....We'll definitely be back - maybe just won't order so much.  Agreed with some reviewers can be a tad pricey - but given the quality, I don't mind paying........worth a visit if you have shied away so far.	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	5	2010-05-08	0	0

It was kinda fun having one we thought.Looking over the menu, they are quite expensive for what I am used to with Sushi. I know its Phoenix, and Sushi is probably pretty hard to come by, but to me this sushi was just average. We had a spicy tuna roll while waiting for our bento boxes and we both agreed it was just ok. A rainbow roll here goes for about 15$ which we both thought this was on the high side compared to some other places we visit.The service was excellent and their staff was very friendly. Its a good place that is semi close to downtown if you need to get your sushi kick for lunch.	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	3	2010-04-27	4	4
1	DlkbXmez19iNaa9gYFtyng	HY9vYr0PF-FlyB9H8jaCFQ	I am a sucker for Japanese restaurants with a Japanese speaking staff.  They also allow patrons to bring their own sake and beer in, since they do not offer any, without a corking fee. Just walking distance across the intersection is a French grocery store that sells wine, sake, and Japanese beer. For appetizers we got the agedashi tofu (not too salty but very hot!), miso Ramen without butaniku (for meat avoiders!), and for nigiri sushi we got halibut, yellow tail, scallop, and albacore. As far as the fish goes my favorite was the halibut - very succulent! I do recommend getting some add ons for the Ramen because it's just noodle, broth, and a couple naruto otherwise. But, the broth was flavorful and the noodles weren't overdone or undercooked. Also, as soon as we sat down we were offered a couple bites of poki nacho...like a true izakaya serving otsumami (finger food)! I would recommend this restaurant for those looking for a some what un-americanized Japanese restaurant with good sushi grade fish. *Side note, the rolls didn't look particularly exciting but we were full with our 1 app, 1 entrée, and 6 pieces of nigiri. I'll be back!	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	5	2016-12-08	0	1

After we were seated, the service was amazing. We didn't have to wait for our drinks to be refilled, and the sushi didn't take long to get to us after we ordered. The sushi itself is phenomenal, I recommend the eel nigiri! Requires no soy sauce or wasabi, it's perfect the way it is! My boyfriend doesn't usually like seafood but it was amazing, and then we found out it was because they used Grade A fish. I can't wait for our next sushi night!

What a great way to start the well needed/deserved weekend...with a fantastic meal!We arrived about 6:30pm and were seated after only a few minute wait.  Our waiter was Nick and he was both helpful and dead on with his recommendations. I had forgotten that it was BYOB so the waiter quickly directed me to a liquor store across the street...niceWe pretty much left the ordering up to him and here is what we had. Toro Tataki....basically a loin of toro rolled in seasoning, seared and sliced thin. Awesome. We followed that with a special call Lil Dino....was a roll w Shrimp inside, thinly sliced scallop on top and a spicy sauce on top of that and then quickly baked...Unbelievable. Next, we had a few pieces of sushi.... giant mackerel and red snapper. Both had great flavor and texture...fresh, sweet and soft as butter!Fresh Grilled Squid w Ginger Soy Sauce....need I say more? YumWe usually pass on dessert but figured we should try one more thing since everything had been awesome!  Wasabi Vanilla Ice Cream....tasted like it sounded and with fresh wasabi on top, we could spice it up even more. Overall, this place rocks....we will absolutely get back there before long.

Newcastle in hand, my friend and I strutted in here at around 8pm on a mildly warm Friday night. the place is jammed, and a couple parties stand around waiting for tables. great, a long wait. nope, two seats open at the bar. sat down, and our beer was immediately taken and put in a fridge to ensure it wouldn't lose any of it's remarkably smooth quality.  first beer is poured, and the excitement ensues. friendly and welcoming server devluges us in the specials, and unfortunately they were out of most of their fish as they have been for three weeks. toro and salmon were our options, so we went with a special for the night, the spider roll, and the vegas roll. also, edamame to start.the food was superb. the edamame came spicy with a side of chili flakes and siracha for our never ending quest to burn the shit out of our mouths. a second round of newcastle was brought upon when our first was finished, and the sushi came shortly thereafter, looking like little pieces of art. both sets of rolls were enormous and came about 6 to a plate. the vegas roll was packed with cream cheese, avocado, and salmon. the special roll, the spider roll, was full of crispy soft shell crab and just enough spicy-ness for a much needed kick in the mouth. one dip in my wasabi/soy sauce concoction was more than enough.our third and final beer was poured by an overly-anxious and over-stimulated, presumably newbie, bus boy. I had about 4 inches of head on my beer and my friend got hers spilled and nearly twice as much head.  he excellent waitress we had made up for this guys slips during the meal. the staff wished us a nice farewell on our way out, and I felt as though I had just left a very close friend's house.

2	XKkKEn_mo19vrM0vVIXiEQ	U82ENdYCmH_9zdOV4b4Baw	"""Very disappointed with OUR overall portions & inflated price.  Our sashimi portions were thinly shaved slivers... They were almost as thin as the ginger slices - most of them ripped and transparent. The sashimi pics that others have posted on FB and here on Yelp, look large and generous.  That is not what we got!  Perhaps they were selfish with us because we weren't regulars.  Maybe they give bigger portions to other folks.  I don't know. My husband and I were excited to go there late June 2013. It was our second time there in the course of 3 years.  The first time, we brought our 1 year old boy with us and we were treated """"carefully"""" by the older woman.  She kept an eye on us as if she was worried our boy would throw food or be noisy.  He behaved well and we left satisfied.  I had recently been reading reviews and viewing pics on the super fresh sashimi. We were also excited to bring our own sake and beer. We had always forgotten in the past.  This time, we did not bring out boy.  We did bring our own booze but our bill was outrageous when we were all done even without alcohol.  We ordered lots of sashimi - six pieces each:  halibut -$12, Octopus at $10, striped bass at $10.  Also had a Vegas at $11.50, & Rainbow roll - I don't recall how much they charged for that one.  Anyway our bill was over $60 and they charged us $1.50 each for splitting the bill!  EACH of us.  That is cheap!There were no sashimi combos offered on menu.  Must order each sashimi separately.  We are used to being lavished with giant chunks/slices of sashimi at Ah So on Bell.  We are regulars there.  Maybe that is why we get so much there.  Hana was not generous with fish at all especially the halibut. Paper-thin!  We will not be going back to Hana. The ambience was fine.  Chefs were a little serious and gruff.  Servers seemed gruff too.  Rushed the bill.  Their price was just not worth what we got. The rolls and the portions of sashimi were just way too small.  We left hungry.Not many sushi places in that area.  Cherry Blossom on 14th Street and Camelback is near.  They are more generous."""	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	2	2013-07-19	0	1

They don't take reservations, so we waited 1/2 an hour for a table (no place to sit, so we stood with about 15 other people).  Then, once we were seated, it took almost 15 minutes more for someone to even take our order, so we didn't eat for more than an hour after we got there.  As I said, the food is very good (not the greatest I've ever had, but still good) ... but I'm not sure it's worth an hourlong wait to eat it.  Next time, we'll go at an off time, or wait for them to expand their space.	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	3	2016-12-31	0	0

All the food was fantastic. The gyoza was great by itself, but even better with the sauce provided. The Takoyaki was very hot, and the first piece cooked my mouth a bit, but was worth it so I have no regrets! I would definitely order it again. The Ramen came with an option of a variety of broth options. I went with the Miso broth on the waitresses recommendation and it was great. The portion was large and with the other food beforehand I was unable to finish the entire bowl.

Until tonight... We went for a Valentine's Day dinner  since my husband is a chef and will be working tomorrow and were delighted to try their Walu special. It was absolutely phenomenal, cooked perfectly and delicious. However.... Walu is also known as escolar had my husband known that it was escolar we would never have ordered the fish. We got home only to have extreme intestinal issues that are commonly associated with eating this fish (Google escolar). We called the restaurant to speak with a manager to let them know that their servers should say what the fish is... Escolar when letting patrons know the specials for the night and got a bit of attitude. Under normal circumstances I would give the maximum amount of stars but considering I am married to my toilet for the next few days one could say it's unethical to serve customers something that is known for giving people who eat it horrible stomach issues. Escolar is banned in Japan for crying out loud and I would have preferred to have made a conscious decision on whether I wanted to consume it.	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	1	2016-02-14	0	0

The broth was delicious and the noodles were tender but didn't fall apart , you had to chew or slurp the whole noodle.  I recommend getting the soft boiled egg with it because the yolk makes the broth fairly rich which I like.Sushi.  The salmon nigiri was buttery and fresh and the rice was good, not dry.  Those were the standouts.  We also had the Hana roll (deep fried goodness) and spicy tuna which were both good but not stand-out.Service:We were greeted at the door by a friendly guy with a cool haircut who advised a table would be ready soon.  After about 30 seconds he apologized and said the table was not available but that there were two seats for me and my girl at the bar.  I prefer the sushi bar anyway so no issue.Server.  After seating we were greeted by our server who was friendly and gave us a moment to decide the order.  She recommended the pork bone over the miso ramen which turned out to be great advise.  Over the course of the meal she returned frequently to quickly check in, then let us return to our conversation.  We were served by her as well as the sushi chef handing the nigiri and rolls directly to us which was cool.Staff was constantly circling the tables taking empty plates and it was a bit loud when chef and servers would talk shop, but felt necessary to keep the place moving at a good pace and it added to the ambiance which felt alive and fun, almost exciting to sit and watch.Takeaway:Get the pork bone ramen and bring a bottle of white wine for a nice date at a good price.

0	jhB_XlqvL7h7lyvOTDasAw	wi31XSqV5LfcF-zxwtLLSQ	"""I really wanted to give this place a 3.5 but unfortunately that's not possible and I felt the experience leaned more toward 3 stars.  So first off we got there on a busy Saturday and it was packed and extremely loud, to the point where you have to yell at the people across your table and can barely hear your server. Then we learned that it was BYOB, but luckily there's a corner market nearby that you can acquire alcohol at. We were told a 15 min wait and that it was a """"high guess"""" but it still took about 15 minutes which wasn't that bad. Finally after getting our table and beer we looked over the menu which had a good amount of items on it and were all very tasty, albeit a bit pricey (20$ for 6 pieces of mackerel are you serious?!). Our appetizers came and they were very good although they were all fried and that's pretty hard to mess up, but I give them the benefit of the doubt and would recommend them.By this point it really starts sinking in that it's very hard to talk and have conversation. I don't mind a rowdy atmosphere at a bar where it's expected and part of the experience, but at a delicate sushi restaurant that doesn't even serve alcohol, I was kind of shocked at the volume. You'll think I'm joking until you're in there and realize that there's no padding or insulation whatsoever and that sound is just reverberating off the walls. It was something we dealt with for the time being but when I remember this place I'm going to remember how loud it was and how happy we were to sit in a silent car for 30 min afterwards, it's pretty crazy. Our sushi arrived with a cute little flaming sugar cube on top of a cucumber slice which was very cool and unique, although we ordered a lot of sushi and they put it on every time so by the third plate, the novelty wears a bit thin. All that aside, I really think the saving grace of this place is the food. If my mouth doesn't mistake me they have fresh wasabi instead of the pre-packaged stuff and the food tasted very fresh. My udon tempura dish took a while to come out of the kitchen but when it did it was very flavorful, rich, and delicious. If I could review different parts of the experience I would say the sushi  and food is a 4/5 rather than a 3/5, but I'm reviewing the restaurant and not just the food. The service was pretty great I must say, but it's kind of dampened when I have to yell my order at you and when you ask me things I almost have to resort to lip reading (yes it's like being at a concert almost). I'm nitpicking a little bit because it wasn't the services fault and I would actually give them a 4.5/5 because they were that good. So you may be wondering why after claiming the food is great and the service even better I'm giving it 3 stars. Bear with me when I tell you that I will never go here on a weekend ever again. There are many sushi restaurants in the valley that are just as proficient and delicious without such a horrific ambience. If you're going alone to enjoy a quick meal you will -have- to sit at the sushi bar due to a rule posted on a sign in the front, and when you're sitting at a bar, with no alcohol, and everyone screaming around you, it really kind of ruins the experience.If you're looking for a place to go during the week I might check it out again because the food and service is good, but all the other small details seem to have been missed when it comes to having a truly fulfilling and extraordinary sushi experience. If you're nearby, give it a go, but steel your nerves because it might test your patience to the limit."""	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	3	2015-08-09	0	0
0	slxKimfFMP_NQMF2J78Nqw	95m28ENZKq4AMfo-Fj5z1g	The owner was nice and accomodating.  The prices were a little too high, but within range of most sushi restaurants.  When the food arrived, we were a little dissapointed.  This place and been highly recommended and we drove across town to get there expecting the best sushi in town.  The sashimi was good, but not as fresh as typically offered by our neighborhood sushi restaurant.  In addition, it was not cut by the chef correctly,  leaving it thin with an odd texture.  The rolls were much better, but were on the small side.  However,  the restaurant was charming, the service was great, and the food was otherwise good.  I can see why this place is always busy with regulars.   It's just not worth the drive across town when we have other more convenient options that we prefer.	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	3	2015-01-01	0	0

11	QuZbJquRtbY9O9JrB9NpxQ	yYlBlBNRieMyLeJmAk0qmQ	I had to reflect on our dining experience at Hana before writing a review.  We had great company while dining here and that certainly colors the experience as a whole.First thing, Hana is BYOB so either don't leave your beer sitting on the counter when you head out like I did or go with cool folks like Kevin H and Marian H who bring a six pack and are happy to share!After reflection I decided that Hana merits about 2.75 stars.  They are better than average but in some important ways they fall short.We did not have any sushi so consider this review for the dinners only.We started with miso soup.  It was very *(salads arrive)* good.  Marian and my wife Audrey were cold every time the ventilation kicked on so the soup was a *(server tries to take Audrey's soup before she is done, is politely rebuffed)* nice warm-up.We were about to start on our salads and *(Audrey and Kevin's shrimp which comes with the steak arrives)* the chef or manager (I'm not sure which) came over and offered to provide several dressing choices so that we could try different ones.  I went with the *(Kevin's steak arrives)* ginger dressing, although the miso dressing was nice as well.  The shrimp which comes with the steak was served nicely arranged on *(server asks if I am done with my salad)* a small plate with lemons, they tasted very *(Audrey's steak arrives)* fresh and delicious.  Marian and I each ordered a tempura dinner.  They arrived and were nice and hot.  The veggie assortment was *(rice bowls arrive)* very good and the shrimp was tender and flavorful.  I found the pieces of fish to be overdone and one bordered on chewy.  The tempura treatment here was good but heavier than most.Throughout the meal two things were occurring that detracted from the overall experience.  The blower would kick on and the cool air was focused against the wall and right on Audrey and Marian.  Kevin and I were cool on one side, warm on the other.  We jokingly discussed changing seats from time to time when we were done on one side and needed to warm up the other.  I suggest an 8 foot ladder and some tweaking of the vents would correct this issue.The food had no pace and toward the end of the meal it become clear that they wanted to turn our table.  Lingering over dessert was not a welcome option.  Water refills stopped toward the end of the meal.In summary:  the food was pretty good, the pace of the food and service was rushed and random, company was excellent and the atmosphere was warm//\\cold//\\warm//\\cold//\\warm//\\cold.

The fish was fresh as you would expect. I had two rolls, including the tuna tataki roll. The amount of tuna was very little. The rice on both  was rolled looser than it should be. My hub's nigiri was fine, the tako and ika were especially good.But was it worth the hour drive and the30% larger bill? No.	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	3	2017-05-15	1	0
0	uGcMQYyBa9XzywVa1qZ6bg	I6MiJPK32h5tZl0On22bxg	Went on my birthday last Wednesday for the first time and it was surprisingly busy for a Wednesday. Ordered the spicy tuna roll, quail egg shooter, hamachi Kama, and some squid nigiri. The spicy tuna was good giving a little extra per piece after the sushi was already cut. Quail egg shooter was delicious. Hamachi Kama was disappointing because it was over cooked and burned at some parts leaving certain parts of the yellowtail collar to be dry and not as mouth melting as it should be. The squid nigiri was good but not the best. I was disappointed they gave me a specials sheet but was out of some things I wanted to try. Especially the monk fish liver. The service was very quick and friendly. I would definitely come back and eat here again to try other things on the menu	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	4	2014-06-26	0	0
0	iUTkWnC_vZet9WSpS6Vekw	MATMGfjs4zULHdzhIF7XMg	After spending our entire lives eating gooooood Asian food in California and the summer in Asia being spoiled by all the authentic delicacies, we were super excited to discover this gem in Phoenix! Hana has the best sushi in AZ, hands down. The yellowtail sashimi is our favorite, because it melts in your mouth. But all the other sushi is really good, including the salmon and spicy tuna roll. The sashimi is so flavorful and definitely tastes fresh. The prices are a bit high, but that wasn't a dealbreaker for us since we know we're in Arizona, sushi comes at a price. The quality of fish here is definitely worth the price, though.Tonkotsu Ramen is wonderful, as well. You have to order the egg on the side, but the pork and egg (if added) are cooked perfectly and the portions for the ramen is huge. It's a good, filling meal at a great price. Definitely recommended!

0	7GX4DkYxJVEERhlE0d5jfw	fPOWyWtv2h4r6j-zXW6qkA	"""I have found my new favorite sushi spot.I wish it was closer to Tempe, but it's worth the drive.You can tell by their menu that Hana strives to be an authentic Japanese restaurant, as opposed to the sake bomber joint that only has food so they can call themselves a restaurant. You know the kind; the Phoenix area is plagued with them. Hana is BYOB, and there are only a few ridiculous fusion rolls on their sushi menu: most of it is authentic, real sushi. On my first visit I started with my usual appetizers, and was immediately struck by how unusually fresh and tasty they were. The seaweed salad had just the right amount of sesame oil, giving it incredible flavor. The veggie gyoza were indescribably delicious. They made me realize I'd never had a fresh gyoza before; every one I'd eaten previously in my life was a pale imitation of these little bits of Heaven.The sushi came out fast, even though it was fairly busy this particular Thursday. The first thing I noticed, naturally, was that someone put a burning sugar cube on the tray. """"Hey, fire!"""" I thought. It was a nice touch.Then I saw, nestled between the flaming sugar and the wad of wasabe, a small pile of what looked like pickle relish. I guessed what it was, and our waitress confirmed it: it was FRESH wasabe.Real, fresh-grated wasabe is something most people never experience. Most people don't even know the pasty green stuff that's standard in every sushi restaurant is just normal horseradish dyed green. The real stuff is just too expensive, and too difficult to keep on hand. But there it was, no extra charge. It adds a little spice and a wonderful, fruity complexity to the sushi. The sushi was great. They also have a large menu with all the other Japanese dishes you'd expect, but I didn't try any of them. Next time."""	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	5	2011-06-06	1	0

While its a small place with maybe 10 tables and bar seating, it is packed with fresh flavors.We sat at the bar last night and while we were waiting, the sushi chef handed us a plate. It was a cucumber/crab salad on a fried wonton crisp. We ordered a bowl of their tempura udon, the Hana roll, the tempura shrimp roll, the spicy tuna roll and the squid salad. The udon broth was seasoned perfectly and a great compliment to the tempura battered veggies and shrimp.The squid salad was tender, lightly seasoned and full of textures. A must-try. This is the only place that actually makes the spicy tuna roll spicy. The food/fish is fresh and the staff is uber-friendly. I like coming here for good sushi, especially since most of Phoenix/Scottsdale usually is full of trendy or not-so-good sushi places.	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	4	2010-01-04	0	1

We've also been here when the other diners have been more reserved and understood how to use their inside-voices. Definitely, I prefer the latter; definitely. Hana is a good value for the cost of dinner. One can bring in one's own wine, beer or sake which is a terrific deal. I've taken in a flask full of sake, warmed up in my lap, for sake bombers and didn't get any funny looks. The fish is fresh (or at least we've been fortunate enough to not have any freshness issues) and brought out in a timely manner. I understand we missed their 2-year anniversary. Bummer.

Thus leaving the fish with little to no taste.-Loads of scallions on everything, rolls and nigiri.  I assume to give it some flavor.-Nigiri all had loads of ponzu on it.  Once again to give it a flavor.  This place has numerous good reviews and I will tell all of you to look harder!

Very tasty!But Hana, this is how I meant for the food to arrive. I did not want my entree of noodles, followed by my appetizer of oysters and then the greens presented as an after thought. Unfortunately, the three other diners that I was with had the same experience. Food arrived randomly. Rush! Rush! It was like Russian roulette.

Be sure to ask what are the Market prices for some delicacies, some are pricy but amazingly fresh and delicious. AND you can take your own alcohol (inside only) without paying any fees for it. Go to restaurant for date night!	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	5	2016-11-29	0	0

We brought a bottle of wine with us and sat down to one of the most amazing meals I have had. Service was great, but the food... O.M.G. the food. The sushi was great, we had the Curry Udon which hands down is one of the best things I have put in my mouth in years. This reataurant is a must visit. Don't wait, just go.

0	a5SyAWeKnNC_pXGnn7jtwQ	hvB1lZ3JQlHigdyRz-wv3Q	I really wanted to love this place, and in my opinion it fell short. Maybe a three star rating is too harsh, because at the end of the day it is one of the better sushi spots I have been to in Phoenix. However, it is still worlds away from my favorite (see my other reviews). Anyways, a couple of things happened at our lunch that dropped my review from 4 to 3 stars. First, despite not serving alcohol, my party of two wracked up a $100 lunch tab...so it isn't cheap. Second, while we were eating they were cleaning the restaurant with a very offensive industrial type cleaner. The smell completely overwhelmed the delicate flavor of some of the fish. Finally, we ordered a toro tataki.,,which was prepared with a kitchen torch. Something must have went wrong because the fish took on an overwhelming flavor of propane gas.

The menus (at table and written on boards) are overwhelming so went with assorted nigiri ,Chef's Special recommended by our attentive waitress.  It was fresh and I also liked the baby eggplant dish.  Next time will give the owner our budget  (as suggested by another Yelp review) and let her order for us to experiment with their other delicacies that I wouldn't recognize from the names.  The photos on their website show such an assortment but no identifiable names to take to the restaurant to order.Overall very good experience, but do not order the green tea ice cream - tastes like soap!  Green tea ice cream tastes like green tea!BYOB is great plus!  Will bring our own sake cups for ambiance instead of drinking sake out of teacups.	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	4	2012-09-18	0	0

If you really like sushi and care about getting 6-8 pieces of sushi (as advertised) as opposed to 5, do not come here. I moved to Phoenix from California and have not tried many other sushi restaurants in the area, but I know I will not come back here. This was definitely an underwhelming and disappointing experience.	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	2	2015-10-18	0	0
3	tWJrrj2WUCCU5l6DwvRnOQ	YeyceeVxQ-PdX3KeVhD-yg	I've been to Hana about 6 times, once at lunch and the rest always at dinner. Each time I have been there I have seen the place full and the diners mostly happy. On two of the occasions we came in with large tables, about 8 people. Frankly the place is a bit small for that, but they accommodated us cheerfully and took very good care of us. Our last visit, on Saturday about a week ago was with 8 people. When we arrived the place, including the sushi bar and patio, was full and they had two other 8 tops. We were seated in about 30 minutes (they don't take reservations but if you have a large party and call ahead they do their best) and were immediately given drinks. Our waitress VOLUNTEEERED to split the check (unheard of!) and did so perfectly into four and with great care. While we were waiting they took our wine and Sake and Chilled it for us and brought it out immediately after we were seated, even splitting the sake into warm and chilled carafes at their own suggestion. The food came out quickly despite the full house and was well received; about 6 of our guests that night were first timers. Every morsel of every dish was eaten and then we ordered more. I see other complaints about the salads and etc. in other reviews, I can't comment I have never eaten anything but sushi there and it has always been excellent, fresh and carefully prepared. My favorites: Dynamite Scallops, Tempura Roll, Spider Roll, Vegas Roll, Poki Chips, Caterpillar roll. It also cracks me up that they sometimes play MXC on the flat screen at the back of the restaurant. Also, the last two times we took 3 or four bottles of wine and were not charged a corkage fee, I assume that this was a courtesy as we spent a couple of hundred dollars on food, but it was appreciated and noticed.

No exaggeration. They were GREAT.2) Next we tried the Lobster Roll Special.  Awesome.  A huge roll with a giant piece of lobster on each piece.3) Moving on to the Dynamite Roll...OMG (you have to say it like a 16 year when she gets the keys to daddy's BMW.)  This was the highlight.  It hardly qualifies as Sushi.  A giant steaming pile of crab, scallops, cheese, and sauces over some type of roll.  Wow.Our server was EXCELLENT when he was around.  He spent  a considerable amount of time explaining several of the specials. He was one of the most knowledgeable servers I have ever had. To be honest, the only negative of our experience was that he only stopped by our table three times in just over an hour...ouch.  If it weren't for having to flag him down to order or get our check, I would have given Hana 5 Stars.I love the fact that they are BYOB.  This is a huge plus.Give this place a shot. I will definitely be back...many times.  GREAT FIND.	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	4	2010-05-13	0	0

I always get sushi and sushi rolls so I can't say anything about the other dishes.  The fish has always been fresh and well prepared.  The rolls are consistently good.  Always a crowd, be prepared to wait.  Get it to go if you want to enjoy the goodness in your own home!  Service has always been good with friendly hosts and servers. BYOB/W is great since restaurants tend to mark up the booze so much.  Gets loud inside, but that's how it goes.	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	4	2015-10-28	0	0
0	hF1Tq7TUuI3B854f5TWuOQ	zNjmB1gCva-Y9BOCGdd_pw	We're regulars at what I strongly believe to be the best sushi in the Valley, and I've been meaning to write a glowing review on Yelp for some time now.  The staff is incredibly friendly, making the service seem effortless.  Its one of the best kept secrets in Phoenix--BYOB.  When you arrive, they put your beer or Reisling in the fridge, and you get it extra cold as they seat you. (Keep in mind that its a really small restaurant, and there is often a short wait before being seated.) They have the standard selection of rolls, with a rotating daily selection of specials.  The fish is nice and fresh, which isn't necessarily the case with sushi in Arizona.  The portions are also generous, and there are a few surprises to the standard rolls.  The specials are all generally good, and I think we've tried most all of them.  The poke chips (chopped up tuna on tortilla/wonton type chips) were a recent miss, but other than that, highly recommended to just let your server suggest what ever is the freshest that day. Another secret about Hana--if you reserve 24-48 hours ahead, they will shop at the market, and make a custom Sunday night feast for you which you can cook at your table. Its ideal for a large group, and totally seasonal and different than anything on the menu.	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	5	2011-03-13	0	0

1	tJfV-r8EuxsTSOReSdCvEw	7fjnkxh19fmtWgJPkhhhQg	Uhhh... WOW!!!So I went here with a large party of 9 which is a little but difficult at this place, because it's a bit smaller so we had to wait til two tables near each other opened up. Once seated, the service was like a whirlwind! It was just too fast. Lol. Attentitive, but fast... There was no time to sit and relax. You have to look at the menus and decide before you take your next breath! My friends and I were a bit stressed and felt under pressure. Lol. So after looking at the menu, on the specials menu, one item in particular popped out at me, which was the gyu don. I've had gyu don before. Usually around 9 bucks, and I like it a lot, however this pricing was around 16.95. I'm a firm believer of you get what you pay for. Here, it included tofu, mushrooms and thinly sliced beef. The server says it takes a little longer than everyone's but it is worth the wait. And I said okay! And of course, it was the last one to arrive at the table. Oh man! That was pretty delicious!! I loved it. It was like a stew. The broth by itself is kinda salty from soy sauce, but it's fantastic with rice, and the tofu, shrooms, and beef were all so beautifully marinaded because of it!Also, the presentation of my friends' sushi was spectacular! There was a sugar cube that was on fire on this plate of really attractively arranged sushi. So despite being stressed out in the beginning, the food really was impressive. Plus, it's byob so the server said we didn't have to wait to sit to pop open some of our beverages.	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	5	2013-12-23	2	1
1	7GGeURmnvZQlPY8DaifiTQ	Iizl0-3Dvt8E9ZSFvMCDoQ	"""This review is the splitting image of Jekyll and Hyde: Hana when going for Sushi (specifically makizushi aka rolls--I'm not much for Nigiri or Sashimi) = 3 Stars. When going for Noodles = 5 stars.Last night I went for sushi and I haven't for a really long time because I feel their sushi is quite pricey in comparison to other sushi 'rants and that there's less roll variety... less you brave the under described Specials Menu. Another annoying thing is that the sushi is BIG. In Japan, you are supposed to eat sushi whole, but when we ordered the Hana Roll (Their best standard roll, IMHO), I could cut it into two perfectly sized pieces--if nori was nicely cut-able so in the end it was a disaster on my plate and eaten piece-meal. I told the friend I was dining with that this is the sushi version of eating ribs on a first date... too messy (At times I had Avocado lipstick moments)... but I have to admit, all the contents of the roll were tasty and I liked their eel sauce consistency and proportions (sometimes it can be over slathered and/or runny, drenching the rice till it's rendered un-sticky and difficult to handle. Remember, traditionally, sushi was meant to be eaten by hand... the original Japanese, sandwich if you will. I did enjoy the way it was presented... on a boat with a little pyrotechnic touch.Now on to the*real* good stuff... The Noodles... I WILL SAY THEY HAVE THE BEST RAMEN IN TOWN! My brother, who I describe as a carboholic eater, but more specifically a noodle-holic states it is his favorite in town hands down... and, so do I. It's the broth that does it. And you get SOOOOO much more when you get any of their noodle dishes. You get a starter salad in the best Miso dressing in town, according to my opinion... and, if you get any of the tempura options, you get the SAME amount of tempura you would get as an appetizer order for $6.95--In Hawaii, you usually only get 1-2 pieces of ebi tempura--to dredge in your bowl of noodles! (Note, the bowl of Tempura Soba is $9.25). It is so hard for me to NOT get this meal because it's warm and comforting for a girl from the islands, and it's own little 3 course meal for one low price! Hard to beat, but I do struggle when ordering because their Yakibuta Ramen (Japanese BBQ pork w/ egg noodles) is also SO good. I've tried to make the pork at home, but it doesn't come out nearly as soft and tasty as theirs... it's heaven! (Good thing you can order it as an appetizer!) The ONLY thing that remotely upsets me about the Noodle portion of Hana's menu is the no substitution clause, which is understandable--the chef wants the noodles to be prepared as they are, but oh would I for once want to change the Soba noodles into Ramen Noodles and add the Yakibuta slices into my bowl that already has Tempura in it! Sometimes a girl just wants it all, all, all, ALL!Now on to the peripherals... There appetizer menu is quite broad... I'm hoping to try the oysters and mussels one day... The Agedashi Tofu is piping hot and tasty with the katsuobushi (fish flakes) that move in dramatic ways as the heat rises from the tofu... sort of eye-boggling and entrancing! And don't forget the Miso, Octopus, Squid Salads, Yakibuta and """"Varietous"""" Tempura plate... all YUMS UP for me! (It was fun haggling with my friend for the veggies we wanted. I got the Shiso Leaf and he felt he got the better deal acquiring the mushroom). Their Bento Box meals are also a great price for the variety of meal you get, and I'll admit, I would buy their Chicken Katsu if I was jonesin' for it but was too lazy to cook it myself.Lastly dessert... I've only been up for it once (Usually too full from apps or already equipped with desire to cross the road and put my Mary Coyle's Ice Cream cravings to rest), but last night, we went all out and tried the Tempura Ice Cream... of which I was surprised it was Tempura MOCHI Ice Cream... I was just expecting a crunch and then ice cream... instead I found some surprise """"Gumption"""" between the two and it made the experience one with strange faces and long tastings and thoughts racing in my head contemplating whether I liked it or not... too long a ponder = the answer: not so much. Nice attempt, but I'd say stick to the subtlety of the Mochi Ice Cream experience!Oh! Almost forgot about service! I must agree with other Yelpers in their spottiness but there is one waiter who has always made a good impression on me. Last night he served us our Ice Cream and since it came with 3 pieces he made a gesture to grab a chair and come join us for the 3rd piece. Another time, he and I enjoyed raving about the awesomeness of the Yakibuta. I also like that he reminds me of those Japanese """"cool kids"""" hanging out in Harajuku.So, all in all, a very roller coaster ride through the land of Hana (Flowers). Definite reasons to come back and definite reasons to steer clear. Just depends on what you're in the mood for. Noodles YES, Makizushi, not so much."""	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	4	2010-01-18	1	2

Their house rolls are worth trying.2. you can bring your own beer.  saves tons of $$$ - and they don't charge you extra for the glasses.3. the manager/owner is a very bossy, older Asian woman who gives you a real run for your money.  The woman doesn't waste a second, and will tell you what to order if you can't decide, even though you haven't asked.  It's entertaining, and I'm always a fan of the pushy Asian mother-types.4. they serve your sushi in a big fancy boat, which is way too big for the table but satisfies my need for drama in dining experiences.

Thick pieces that tasted very fresh. The spicy tuna we ordered had a lot of tuna for the price and was very tasty.

Our group of 4 came here Friday night for dinner and business was bustling. We had to wait around 15 minutes for a table which wasn't so bad considering how busy it was.The menu is very stream lined but the focus is still always dedicated to the freshness and quality of their sushi. We enjoyed salmon sashimi and uni sashimi. The spicy tuna roll was delightful and the spiciness did not overcome the fresh flavor of the tuna. One of my favorites, unagi nigiri, did not disappoint! We definitely plan to return here. Our go-to will most likely be the scallop dynamite, which our friends ordered and we tried and loved. The uni oyster shooters were fun and yummy. It's a great way to introduce people who don't usually eat uni to enjoy the unique melt in your mouth texture. I'm slowly starting to enjoy uni since we order it so much. I think I could get others addicted to it too!	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	4	2015-08-23	8	5

It's rare that I find an establishment that I have dined at that really blew my mind in so many ways. Hana is so much more than just a sushi restaurant. It is a place where you can find Japanese Kaiseki dining, there is as much love in the Tempura as there is in the uni and oyster shooter. There is no fluff or fuss over the food here, just super high quality ingredients that have been perfectly balanced the way that the ingredients are meant to be enjoyed. Simple flavors, quality ingredients and lots of love and passion in the kitchen. Japanese cuisine and culture is something that I have always found intriguing. I had the opportunity to chat with one of the owners while there... I really enjoyed hearing about her passion for the restaurant, her travels to Japan and learning more about the amazing chefs that work at Hana. I can't wait to come back to Hana, enjoy more of their delicious food. This place lives up to the hype.... Believe it!	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	5	2016-09-13	10	4

Besides the great food and service, we also love the no-corkage BYOB. We usually bring a white wine, and they make sure to put it in an ice bucket for us.Hana has a good variety of well executed classics and lots of unique specials. The Hana tamago was recently featured in the Republic's food section with good reason. It's a really cool dish featuring a tempura battered soft boiled egg set on top of a delicious creamy sauce. Get it and don't share! I also had the heirloom tomato sashimi a few months ago and loved it. As a vegetarian, it's great to see a sushi chef's attention to detail extended to veggies as well.My husband is the meat eater in the family so he has got to enjoy some awesome seafood dishes. Most recently, he had a beautiful looking lobster dish (his favorite of the night) and an entire grilled squid. He also had high praises for a tuna roll topped with fried garlic as well.We are really looking forward to coming back with friends and family so we can share Hana's goodness.

This is pretty high in the restaurant industry, but it explains why they are on the same par Hatsuhana (midtown) in NYC. I've been coming here since it opened and they have always maintained that quality over the years.	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	5	2016-02-09	1	0

This place doesn't really authentic Greek food and would easily be clumped into the Turkish/Middle Eastern/Greek fast food places. But hey, I don't mind.Their menu is standard: your choice of meat (gyro), splash of hummus, some Greek fries (topped with feta - Greeks don't do this btw but who cares), some middle eastern salads, and you're set!The portions are huge and you'll be satisfied every time. Meat is flavorful (garlic spices) and everything that's topped with feta is good in my book.Beware of the """"Greek breath"""" though. You'll stink of garlic all day.

The service was quick, and you get to stand and watch them cook your order as you wait, which is both amusing and comforting to see for a 'fast food' type environment.In all, the price was fair and the taste was delicious; comparable or better than any other quick-service Greek places I've tried. If you're in the mood for some quick takeout and want something a little outside the normal cuisine options, don't shy away from this place. Give it a shot.	pYMvH35_h47NnNTqjav56A	4	2013-11-22	1	0
2	oaaEXgQ3x51cXE3GTXrT1Q	4kngZbk1vw_0D4brgm2YGQ	I'm going to keep this brief... Taste of Greek is fantastic. The french fries are some of the best I've ever had. I'm not even a fan of thicker fries normally, but these were crazy good. Hot and crispy. I had a gyro as well - the meat was cut right in front of me and was cut into really thin strips - almost like a Philly Cheesesteak. I'm a fan of this style. Their tzatziki sauce is delicious and fresh. The pita was also fresh and soft... the entire thing was the size of my head and while I managed to scarf it all down, I was too full to finish every french fry (but not for a lack of trying). This place is really clean, and everything is cooked and prepared out in the open. It's fast-casual style, but they weren't super busy when I went and they were bringing food out to the tables which was nice. Most of the tables could only seat two people which makes this perfect for a quick lunch with a co-worker or by yourself. They have a few tables that seat more, but it's not a huge restaurant.The staff is friendly and helpful. This is a family owned Valley business - they are apparently related to a few other places around town (not all the same name, but the ones I've eaten at were also very good). The only thing this place is missing is delivery. If these restaurants would deliver, they would be unstoppable. Oh, and there needs to be one really close to my house.I'm definitely going to be back.	pYMvH35_h47NnNTqjav56A	5	2011-12-20	3	3

I always see it when I go to Sprouts but I'm always over there before they open.When I finally made my way over there in the afternoon I got a gyro and fries.  I took it home had maybe 3-4 bites and fed the rest to my dog.  It was so greasy that I had oil dripping down my face.  It was flavorless which I thought was impossible for gyro meat.  The tzatziki was flavorless as well and really watered down.  The fries were OK.  I've eaten a lot of gyro's in my life and this one was not good.  The gyro place on Northsight is only about 5 minutes away from here and 100 times better.	pYMvH35_h47NnNTqjav56A	2	2012-03-04	0	0

Lo and behold, I found Taste of Greek as I was waiting in the endless drive-thru lane at Starbucks. Greek . . . one of my favorite cuisines . . . could they possibly have Babaganoosh? And if so, will it be any good? Today, on my way back from a doctor's appointment, I stopped in and there was my beloved Baba on the menu.  I ordered some to go. Ahh, it is so delicious . . . very smooth and smoky.  I wonder if they make it themselves? Who cares? It's delicious. Can't wait to try the gyros. Everyone seated had one and they looked very satisfying :)The counterperson was very sweet and enthusiastic. The gentlemen cooking were very focused on what they were doing. They barely looked up until one of them called my number for pick up. He, too, was very personable and thanked my for my business.The restaurant itself is small, great for take-out. Drinks are self-serve. Taste of Greek will definitely be part of my regular rotation!	pYMvH35_h47NnNTqjav56A	4	2011-10-24	2	1

Tzatziki sauce is really a sauce, not just sour cream.  Hot fries are great...and I am not a fries fan.  The guy at the counter taking orders is super gracious on the customer service front.

0	lCuz3BhOql2gmz7BNK0g1Q	RPX3FmeED8a4DfMeE6fqYQ	An honest review of the food: it's pretty bad.I had a gyro and it was good/ok. Too much meat, could use a little more sauce, but overall it was not bad.I'm just getting to the bad part.My wife ordered the tabouli salad. She had to spit it out. It was 90% parsley, and it was very, very bitter. Inedibly bad. Took it back to the counter and the man, who was *very* nice and accommodating, agreed to refund our money or give her something else.So the man brought us samples of hummus and baba ganoush.The hummus tasted like a dirty dish rag, and I'm not trying to be funny. My guess is that they cleaned the bowl they made it in with dirty rags and thus imparted a mildew taste and smell. The texture was not like any hummus I have ever had before, more like mayonnaise with no tahini or lemon taste at all. Just awful.The baba ganoush was no better than the hummus. We believe it was simply hummus mixed with a little boiled eggplant. It also has the same dirty dish rag taste and smell as the hummus. Just plain bad.As for atmosphere, well there isn't one. Semi-clean, semi-dirty, dark, with no decorations except for some gyro posters. I'm not trying to be mean, but it's akin to something you would find in Glendale, not Scottsdale.Why one star? Well the man that helped us was very pleasant and refunded our money, plus the gyro was not bad.	pYMvH35_h47NnNTqjav56A	1	2013-11-26	1	1
3	M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA	PqwUHZkqsh3PlZVVqOd_XQ	01/05/132.5 stars.Came here on a Persian coworker's suggestion I try it.  I was informed by the nice young man that Taste of Greek was out of the steak pita that my coworker told me to check out.  (Since I try to avoid chicken and lamb due to food allergies, steak and chick peas are the only proteins I'd be considering, anyway.)  Since steak was not an option tonight, I went for a la carte items of chicken pita ($7.95), regular hummus ($4.50 or $4.95), and a couple of falafel balls ($1 for two pieces).Surprisingly, it took longer than I expected to prepare the falafel balls and pita wrap, which I took as a good sign that they were cooked-to-order.  The hummus was the only one that was pre-prepared, and it came with ONE olive.  A rather tasty olive at that, and it was a pity that it was all by its lonesome, since the bite that included it was the only time I thought the hummus was worthwhile... Still, I've kept the container in the fridge, as it still is a protein source.  (However, now that I think about it, if it's not organic, then really, I'm not doing my body any favors- SAY NO TO GMO!)The falafel balls were piping-hot and tasty, albeit a tad too salty.  Again, I'm going to assume the chick peas weren't organic and the soybean oil used to fry it wasn't either, so this may be the last time I ever speak of them...  The first few bites of the pita wrap didn't win me over UNTIL I remembered to add the tzatziki sauce I'd requested to be on the side (cuke allergy).  After I'd slathered on the homemade sauce, it was  very good!  Worthy of a few allergy symptoms, even.  I'll be coming back to give the steak wrap a try, but I doubt I'll be back for the other items, unless ToG  goes organic.  If you know of any organic mediterranean restaurants, please let me know!  :)	pYMvH35_h47NnNTqjav56A	3	2013-01-17	6	3
0	O7ojHP59iSi32uhEDUR44A	esQRVnPytxq1kvbDbIH46w	Good place to grab lunch. They use fresh ingredients and the serving size/price is reasonable.- Greek Salad: Pretty good. There were lots of fresh veggie toppings and a ton of feta. I prefer more lettuce on my salads, but that's my only complaint. The tahini sauce it came with tasted a little spoiled, thankfully it was on the side. For only 50 cents more I got a huge soft pita on the side.- Falafal: Really good. Most restaurant's falafal balls are dry and plain tasting, so I was very pleasantly surprised that these were moist, fresh, and quite flavorful. Highly recommend!- French Fries: Mmm their fries are great. Big, crispy, and soft in the middle.- Gyro: I don't eat meat, but my boyfriend really likes the gyros. They look very sizable, and the tzatziki sauce is very good.	pYMvH35_h47NnNTqjav56A	3	2012-02-15	2	2
1	YtWp5i-4XDqgaUMiY2h9rg	iXGsrw2k5GHXXC5VY_loyQ	LOVE LOVE LOVE this place.  Should have been 5 stars, but let me explain:On a girls-only trip, a friend of mine and I visited Scottsdale, AZ over Labor Day weekend and decided to try this place out.  My friend and I split the Fattoush (Mediterranian) Salad and thought we'd died and gone to Heaven!  There was so much of it, we were able to save 1/2 of it for the next day's lunch.  My only complaint is that on Sunday, we wanted to go back and get another couple of salads (YES, IT WAS THAT GOOD!) for dinner.  We knew that it would be closed on Monday, so we Googled the website to find out what the hours were on Sunday (they close at 6pm) and we actually left the swimming pool early so that we could be at the restaurant by 5:15 pm (in case they wanted to close a little early since the next day was a holiday).  Guess what?  They were CLOSED!  The sign on the door said that they were closed on Monday, 9/3 - nothing about closing early on Sunday, and I even checked the hours of operation sign to the right of the door to make sure their closing hour was 6pm on Sunday.  They didn't just miss out on me and my friend, we watched 2 other cars with people walk up to the door and do the same thing we did (pull on door, read sign, look at hours of operation sign to the right of door, look at watch, lean into glass with hands cupped around eyes to see if someone was hiding inside, pull door handle one more time, shake heads and walk back to car.)SO DISAPPOINTED!  Had they been open at 5:15pm on Sunday,  I would have given them 5 stars.Hopefully they'll still be there next year when we go back to Scottsdale!  I'm buying a week's worth of food, in case they decide to close early without notice again!	pYMvH35_h47NnNTqjav56A	3	2012-09-13	2	1

0	ELcQDlf69kb-ihJfxZyL0A	vimXMUFi-Zf_1TaCIYyF6A	The chicken here is better quality than most. It seems to be marinated in something yellow, but was fresh and reheated on the grill before entering my open pita for the Chicken Pita. Good dose of Tzaztki sauce and I added 50 cents for feta cheese (which should be included). Otherwise, it had all the regular stuff, but this chicken made the difference in sandwich star quality. Only issue is that the sole lunch special is for the GYRO which is normally $5.95. My pita only costs $6.25, but owner gives you drink and fries for about a buck, instead of 3 bucks. Not sure why chicken and any pita cannot be on special for lunch. This is a bit infuriating.l Respect the chicken!	pYMvH35_h47NnNTqjav56A	4	2013-10-19	0	0

Food is always excellent, never had a complaint.  The food is a bit pricey though considering that other Greek restaurants in the neighboring towns will offer $6 for the same meal.   Usually my bill goes very close to $10 - $11.  Other than that, it is a solid place to get some Greek food.	pYMvH35_h47NnNTqjav56A	4	2013-06-15	0	0

The parts I did get to eat were very delicious though. The staff was very friendly as well.

1	Hr6ZuwCBRJ4CR1VRhs4OZQ	spgPN9AgUMcl-W-iHweyyw	The food here is consistently good, but let's face it ladies...if you've lived near downtown Scottsdale for a while, you've heard about the hot waitstaff.  They even had their own calendar for a couple years!  Sadly, on a recent birthday outing with 4 other girls, we were disappointed to find that the hot young boys were nowhere in sight (no offense to the fine waiters that do work there).  That's the real reason we chose Brioni's, as there are other places to get good Italian food if that's what you're after.  Granted, it may be that the boys had the night off for their other job with the Chippendales, but I doubt it.   We were there on a Friday night, and they seated us in a room I didn't know existed (the place is huge, with several rooms), not in the bar area where I'd had good times in the past.  The service was good, although the corner where we were seated smelled like old wood...?  It seems the crowd here has aged a bit as well..not that there's anything wrong with that...but it was more of the close to retirement set, rather than hot middle-agers like us!  Bottom line: still great food, good place to take visiting family around the holidays, but unfortunately the man candy is gone...	a11zyJN_ue0CQ_bjoeke-w	4	2008-08-12	2	1

Super friendly and welcoming. My waiter was flippin' fantastic. I'm not sure if he was the owner or manager or something, he was dressed differently than the other wait staff. He gave some fantastic recommendations, he was funny, just an all out pleasure. The food was also fantastic. I read one review that complained about the sweet butter that they serve with the bread: I admit, I was first taken aback by it but learned to love it. All in all, great food, great service, fantastic ambiance. Perfect.And I almost forgot one more thing! One of the people I went with is gluten-free (I know, **groan** haha just kidding), and our server brought out a piece of gluten free, flourless chocolate cake on the house. We didn't even ask for anything for dessert. It was a very welcome surprise, and the cake was damn good.	a11zyJN_ue0CQ_bjoeke-w	5	2016-09-26	0	0
1	siMQh5yExP9jo5LezfL9zw	sHtAIpn9bkiAex9c_j6-wQ	The food was excellent! HOWEVER...the Service was nonexistant! We arrived at 6:40PM 1/19/2013, we were told they didn't have our reservation for 6. They were able to seat us within 5 minutes on the heated patio. We were handed menus and then the Waiter dissappeared. Later on another waiter came and introduced himself as Mike and he would be taking good care of us. He took our drink order and we never saw him again. Later on the original Waiter came and said he'd help us out. He brought us our drinks and asked if we wanted bread. They gave us all a warm roll and dissappeared again. We had no butter or dipping oil for the bread. One os our friends got up and fetched oild and vinegar from the waiter station. Later on the original waiter came back to take our order. When I said that I believe we were abandoned, he said that they were busier than usual and that I hurt his feelings. He took another drink  order but didn't return with them. Another 3rd waiter came back with our drinks about 20 minutes later. Our food was great but then it took another 30 minutes to get our bill. It took them 2 hours and 20 minutes to serve us from start to finish. The whole time, I watched to see how busy they really were and the poor service was due to disorganization. Not one women works there and I think that's a big part of their problem. Women would have been organized and efficient. These guys were all nice but not very on the ball and generally overwhelmed. I don't think it had to do with being busy (there were empty tables the whole time), just laziness and/or an inability to be organized and efficient. We won't go back again.	a11zyJN_ue0CQ_bjoeke-w	2	2013-01-20	0	0

They offer a wide range of Italian fares from pasta, pizza, seafood, and more. They also have a large wine list as well.The decor reminds me of the old school NYC Italian restaurant. The dim lighting sets the right mood for drinks and food. For dinner I got the salmon with a glass of white wine. The salmon was very delicious. It was perfectly cooked and marinated. Each bite made me wanting more and more.Overall, great food and fantastic service. I will definitely consider coming back the next time I am in town.	a11zyJN_ue0CQ_bjoeke-w	4	2017-07-22	1	0

2	yOM891kAdwni5ecnGsQcWw	O8pP_jNkIBtChBkNRn6STg	I really like this little place.  :)The food is very good, and I've never had a bad meal here.  Salads, calamari, red sauce, pastas, bread, olive oil...all very, very good.  Dessert was kinda meh (though I ate it anyway - it's rude to wrap with Italians), but they have a decent wine list, so eat up, and skip dessert.98% of the all-male staff are exceptionally hot, btw (there might have been women working there, but I didn't notice in the sea of tall, dark and handsome and dressed in black).  Playing for both teams, and perhaps even bridging some gaps, there is plenty of eye candy and flirt-worthy boys for everyone.  I was tempted to write my number on a few bev naps and pass them around to anyone who eye fucked me longer than 10 seconds.  I'd recommend not taking a date you're pretty into just for this reason (lesson learned - lol).	a11zyJN_ue0CQ_bjoeke-w	4	2012-07-24	0	0

0	fk6ivG91rDBdc7dbxfDr_A	TJh3rEgoe5RGxXG_FOq1PQ	A huge group of us (we filled about 8 tables) were visiting Phoenix and our hosts recommended Pasta Brioni.  The food and service were amazing, despite the challenges of feeding 75 people all at once.  Servers got us our drinks quickly, refilled our water glasses often, and kept those huge yummy rolls coming!  We ate family style (ordering 4 big dishes to be shared), and yet the kitchen was able to accommodate a few of us who had dietary restrictions (vegetarian, gluten-free).  The salad was a healthy prelude to all the fantastic food to come!  The penne vodka was the best i've ever had - the pasta was pleasantly al dente and the vodka sauce has a nice mix of flavors (slightly tangy, slightly sweet, slightly peppery).  The meat-eaters at the table were equally ranting and raving about the veal shiitake (in a marsala sauce) and the chicken martini (in a white wine sauce).  Can't wait to go back the next time we're in Phoenix!!	a11zyJN_ue0CQ_bjoeke-w	5	2016-05-17	0	0

My daughter wasn't feeling well so we ordered soup it took them 45 minutes before they even realized she was never given the soup, I had to ask for it. We didn't get out of there until a quarter after eight we had to wait an hour and 15 minutes for our food. A party of eight came in after us and left 25 minutes before us. Not too happy with them.

I live 2 min form this restaurant so I got it delivered to my house. Well, how to say it? It has to be the worse pasta I've ever had. So much cream I couldn't even find the pasta in the plate, there is no flavor whatsoever. I felt like the opened a can of tomato sauce, added some cream and pepper to eat and bye bye. Seriously guys.!!Same for the bread, It was plain and not so good. I know some of you might think that because it got delivered, this is the reason why it was bad. But no, everything was very hot when it got here. The only good thing was the can of coke!	a11zyJN_ue0CQ_bjoeke-w	2	2017-01-22	0	0

Ruins the meal. The Penne vodka sauce was good with over cooked, I imagine precooked and reheated pasta. I added chicken; that should have been grilled and seasoned, but was no doubt boiled with no flavor whatsoever. I did not even eat it for the extra 3 bucks.  If you bring bread to the table, bring butter, but not butter that is so hard you can't even get it on the bread. Pasta Brioni is saved by the ambiance.	a11zyJN_ue0CQ_bjoeke-w	2	2016-05-01	0	0

Number two, my husband had a soft drink and asked for a refill. He was charged for 2 soft drinks. Who charges for refills these days??

Delivery charge is $1, unlike many of the chain places around that charge quite a bit more. I've always had really great service. If there is something up they've always called me right away and I've yet to meet one of their delivery folks I haven't really liked.

2	XrsyfOHI940MroW6MFoJIw	Ne6ZXFrJAJZ9emI_ppLrbQ	I like Brioni's.  The Happy Hour specials are a steal.  The ambiance is usually very good.  I like the old school formal wooden decor.  The food is anywhere from good to outstanding depending on the item.  In general, they follow the Italian tradition of choosing the best ingredients, instead of gimmicky crap.I really like the mussels with the marachiara sauce.  That (clear tomato with garlic) sauce is worth a trip.  The calamari salad is also a wonderful and healthy choice.  Split that with a friend at happy hour followed by a pasta dish and you're eating like a king for nothin'.  I've had 4 or 5 pasta dishes that were all great.  Today, I had the chicken sorrentino which was very good.However, I did have one bad experience that I'd like to share for the purpose of entertaining Yelpers and perhaps fixing the issue at a restaurant I enjoy eating at.If you're about to eat, you might want to stop reading.  - I ordered my food.  It was a later in the lunch hour and pretty empty.- I went to the bathroom.- After going, I saw there was NO toilet paper.  This is pretty bad for an upscale restaurant, but whatever.  Call it an oversight.- So, I called the restaurant from my cell phone and explained that I was in the bathroom in need of toilet paper.- No one ever came.  I gave up because I was in a hurry during the work day.- After eating, I checked the bathroom again.  Still, no toilet paper.I know this is a weird situation and I've eaten here about six times with no similar issues.  I was too bashful to bring it up again in person and there was no feedback link on their web site.  So, I'm hoping someone will read this review at the restaurant and fix the issue so that it does not happen again.	a11zyJN_ue0CQ_bjoeke-w	4	2011-03-05	1	0

The servers are very attentive- perhaps a little overly- (are lap dances always included with your meal)?? The servers aren't the only good part of this restaurant though.  The food is delicious.

It seems no one there knows how to smile or make a guest feel welcome. I had made on line reservations 5 days prior to our visit on 4/27. we arrived a few minutes before our 7 PM reservation by a very disinterested host/manager who offered no greeting other than """"please follow me"""". At this time he proceeded to lead us to the outside patio, it was in the mid 90's that day and I had no desire to sit outside. When  I advised him that I would prefer to sit in one of the two open tables in the main dinning room his only comment other than let me check was that there was no preference on my reservation to which I replied that most restaurants ASK if we would like outside dinning.I followed him back to the host stand where after a moment he said OK take the table in the dinning room,  he made no effort to escort us there and an attitude was clearly shown. It took  a waiter a good 5 minutes to greet us at the table and apologize for being behind and that he would return shortly. From here on the service was painfully slow and other than at the end the server finally said he was sorry that the kitchen was backed up. Mr. Personality that originally sat us was positioned but a few feet from our table the entire meal never did stop by and say hello or say that he was sorry for any seating issues that we incurred.By the way, the food was just OK, not worth the 25 minute trip when I have Maggiano's, Carrabba's and Nicks all within two miles of my home. NO one at Pasta Brioni's even tried to make me feel like I was a valued guest. I prefer to spend my $$$$ where my presence is appreciated.JC"""	a11zyJN_ue0CQ_bjoeke-w	2	2013-04-28	1	0

It has been in the Valley FOREVER and most often my family gets takeout but I have to say, dining in is a super fab experience. They bring you warm, doughy rolls to start that are absolutely delicious. The best part, they have EVOO + Balsamic on the tables so that you can dip your bread! {my guilty pleasure} We split a bottle of delicious Chianti and then for my meal, I ordered a garden salad with their homemade Italian dressing {so yum!} and the piccata but subbed chicken for veal. It was SO tasty. I got it with a side of spaghetti that was just pretty average, I thought the noodles were a tad overdone but that is my only sorta complaint. All in all, I left SO full and ready for bed! Did someone say food coma? I would totally recommend Pasta Brioni for a family dinner, birthday, catering, you name it!

Bartender was super friendly and service was good. We ordered a ton of food and had quite a bit in front of us. A closed bottle of olive oil fell over the front of the bar.  A greasy rude dude that worked there picked it up and made some comment about how EXPENSIVE it was and how that was the last bottle until the delivery tomo. Really!!! An italian restaurant and I potentially spilled the last bottle of Olive oil in the entire place and may have put them line down for the night....Keep up the customer service buddy!	a11zyJN_ue0CQ_bjoeke-w	3	2012-05-22	2	0

Even though we had a reservation, we weren't sat at a table until 7:45. At this point, we realized how disorganized the staff was - we had random mis-matched silverwear (at a table with four of us, it took them 10 minutes and 3 tries to get an almost complete set of silverwear - meaning a fork, a knife, a spoon and a side plate - for everyone at the table.) We also didn't get a menu for almost 15 minutes. Definitely some issues with the service. Although we sat at 7:45, our server didn't take our order until 8:15. It took almost 20 minutes for our appetizer salads to arrive, around 8:35. After we finished our salads, it was another 30 minutes before we had our main courses - they didn't arrive until after 9:10. At this point we were starving, the server tried to make light of the situation - apologizing for the delay and joking that he bet we had time to work up an appetite. The food was very mediocre - not terrible, but nothing special. In my opinion, definitely not worth the hour wait. They also didn't get all of our orders right - my friend had ordered a pasta dish with chicken, only to have it come out without chicken. Another friend was very disappointed with her meal and barely touched it, she didn't complain but I was surprised they didn't offer to bring her something else or take it off the bill. We were all laughing about what a disappointing 2-hour experience it was from start to finish - we won't be back!	a11zyJN_ue0CQ_bjoeke-w	2	2014-01-22	3	0

We sat on the back patio which was great and our waiter was fantastic. The antipasto was delicious, as was the bread and oil for dipping. I wasn't able to order my own food since there was such a large group which was unfortunate, but they served a wide variety of pizza, and it was all pretty tasty. I would definitely eat here again.	a11zyJN_ue0CQ_bjoeke-w	3	2012-05-29	2	0

I got the lasagna which was recommended to me by the waiter, and it was your average lasagna. A little too much cheese put on the top.

Quite a bit higher than we had expected, but we were hungry, so we ate.The eggplant rollatini was to die for.  My partner said it was almost as good as her grandmother's, and that is saying A LOT. We decided to split the pumpkin ravioli, and although the addition of fresh corn was a little odd, it was really delicious, and one plate was the perfect portion for two; better yet, they split it for us in the kitchen, making it easier.The servers were quick about our iced tea refills, and one of them chatted up my partner as they were both from New York.I'm giving 4 stars (instead of 5) for the price being a bit high, and the oddness of having sports play while eating $14 ravioli.	a11zyJN_ue0CQ_bjoeke-w	4	2010-05-04	2	2

0	H_xC0fepAS5BufkfCN2NNQ	tT2zIEMtU4bmSr_tZ-ys3w	"""Being from Europe I tend to be avoid """"Italian"""" restaurants in the US that lay the fake Italian on you thick. This wasn't the case for Pasta Brioni. I've been avoiding going because I tend to trust Yelpers but I was honestly pleasantly surprised. I went for a friends birthday and there were three of us. I tend to stay away from """"suggestions"""" or """"specials"""" bu the waiter did a great job of going over them and not being pushy. To start with the negatives, I'd say that my restaurant experiences (French,Italian or otherwise at least in Europe) begin with a few rolls of bread in a basket at your table and some butter (or olive oil). They weren't far off providing one roll and your customary olive oil but with a twist in that the bottle had an opening for balsamic vinegar which made for a great blend. I had the spinach and ricotta dumplings and the waiter was kind enough to suggest having it served with the vodka cream sauce. A great choice. My two friends had the capellini primavera (which I helped finish and it was delicious) and the chicken picatta (which I did not taste but looked equally good). All that capped with a bottle of Chianit and it was a great start to our Saturday night.I'd probably recommend it for a date or with family  or a large group but definitely not for parents with young children as it wasn't necessarily the most casual place to dine."""	a11zyJN_ue0CQ_bjoeke-w	4	2009-11-30	0	0

This has nothing to do with the pasta, which was mediocre at best.  This has to do with the absolutely abysmal service we recieved.We were completely ingored for the majority of our meal.  At one point I had to go to the bar and ask our server, who was engaged in a lengthy conversation with a female patron, for a Coke refill.  When he came do the table he slammed our drinks down and left without a word.  Clearly, he was to busy flirting to be bothered with work at work.I can safely say that I will not be returning to this place.  I prefer my pasta without the uppity Scottsdale attitude.	a11zyJN_ue0CQ_bjoeke-w	1	2009-06-24	2	0

We were told to sit wherever we wanted, we chose a booth in the lounge. The decor was nice, pretty typical for a small Italian restaurant.The service was awkward but I think the server was new, he didn't mess anything up, he just did odd things. Like he took our order and had to come back again because he forgot what my boyfriend had ordered. After our meals were delivered (by someone else) our server came by and said """"once your pasta arrives, do you want cheese? OH! It's already here! I'm blind!"""". We chose to laugh about the slightly bizarre service, we have both been the new kid before too. I liked the rolls that came before dinner but the oil/vinegar bottles were both leaky so made a mess of our hands and the table.I had the balsamic chicken, I really liked that this restaurant offers an under 650 calorie menu, as I wasn't starving and not really in the mood for pasta it was a good choice. I thought it had a good flavor and I enjoyed what I ate of it, I wasn't super hungry and had already had a lot of bread. My boyfriend had pesto chicken pasta, I noticed him doing something strange during the meal,  he kept taking a bite of his meal and then pulling pieces of chicken out of his mouth and putting it on the bread plate. I asked him what was wrong and he said """"I don't know, it's like cartilage or something, it's just...not good"""". He did finish the dish though (except for the ever growing pile of chewed chicken on the bread plate). We left and agreed that we wouldn't be back.Unfortunately, the reason for this place doesn't even deserve the 1-star, midnight found us both on the bathroom floor. Him, projectile vomiting from a textbook case of food poisoning and me playing nurse. Great way to end our Saturday date night."""	a11zyJN_ue0CQ_bjoeke-w	1	2015-10-25	0	0

That was until lastnight.  Maybe it's the state of the economy causing the need to watch their costs because they seem to be cutting back on critical ingredients.  The chicken breast in the parmesana and bianco chicken entrees were pounded to a paper thin thickness.  Also, there were very few small, diced pieces of shrimp in the penne vodka shrimp entree.  This used to be served with medium-sized, whole shrimp.  Next time when Italian food sounds appetizing, this will not be on the list.  It was very disappointing.	a11zyJN_ue0CQ_bjoeke-w	2	2008-09-07	0	0

We had good service from arrival to departure. I think we were the only customers when we arrived at 1:25.  The wine list was a disappointment.  My wife was planning on a bottle of an interesting Italian white wine but there was little to choose from.   The red wines offered more but the list was not extensive.  There are a lot of American winesTwo of us had spaghetti and meatballs. It was a good choice. The portion was very large and tasty. I have had sauce I liked better but that is a matter of preference. My wife had pappardelle bolognese. The sauce was meaty and rich and dotted with chunks of fresh mozzarella. Other friend had a chicken sandwich and was happy.  Wife and I  split a portion of flourless Chocolate cake. It was good. Friends split a pumpkin cheesecake and liked it.

We sat out on the patio after being immediately greeted and welcomed and given a choice of sitting in the restaurant or outside.  There is a nice mix of bar seating, dining room and patio.  We went on a Wednesday night in March so it wasn't overly busy.  The patio was nice and cozy and had good furniture and heat lamps incase.  The waiter we had was named Stallone.  He was great.  Very attentive to our needs and made us feel like we were long lost customers he hadn't seen in ages.  We also met the restaurant owner Dave who was great.  There was a medical incident in the restaurant while we were there and the staff handled the first responders and customer with attentiveness, class and dignity.  We mentioned to Dave that we heard the cannoli was recommended but overpriced according to some other Yelp reviews so he brought us one on the house.Dish portions were large and we couldn't finish what we had ordered.  Great night.  One star was lost because of the location.

This evening, the server, Megan, and Chef Michael Siggins outdid themselves. My dr. recently put me on a strict anti-inflammatory diet where all legumes, grains, dairy and nightshades (like tomato and eggplant) are out of the question (which sucks tremendously when dining at a fabulous Italian restaurant). Megan listened to my limitations, made great suggestions, and when she told Chef Siggins about my dilemma, he personally came out to talk to me, and ultimately created a delicious, satisfying dish that was completely in line with what I'm allowed to eat. The level of care Megan and Chef Siggins showed for my dietary limitations and the quality of the scrumptious dish I enjoyed were far and away beyond what I expected. They obviously take a lot of pride in what they do.  Many thanks and kudos!	a11zyJN_ue0CQ_bjoeke-w	5	2014-08-14	1	1

I ended up there on the last day of Yelp Eats with a group of friends in a craving for Italian. From what I saw on their menu, I was very excited to see what was i store for me and had heard pretty decent things. I walked out not that excited. The ambiance inside is very nice, though a bit on the dark side. The decor inside told a completely different story than what I was thinking when I saw the entrance. It is very posh inside and I did like the comfy booths.We arrived early enough to get the early bird special, which appeared to be a better deal than the yelp eats one. I wonder if this was truly our best choice. For me when it comes to pasta, I am a bit picky. This mainly comes from the fact that I don't like really heavy sauces and I really do not like tomatoes. It has to be a good Italian place and not your run of the mill to get me excited.My first course was a Caesar salad. Wait take that back. That was supposed to be my first course. I believe I really got romaine lettuce, croutons and dressing of the day. It definitely was *not* Caesar. This left me sad. The bread with it though was pretty damn good although I suggest bigger bottles of balsamic. We ran out fast! My main course was chicken marsala and a side of penne. The penne came with a paste (note I did not say sauce) and seemed a little dry and bland. The chicken marsala was actually decent but pretty run of the mill and nothing spectacular. Dessert involved two mini cannolis. Like the pasta, they seemed a little dry and lacking, but were flavorful. Overall my meal was really just okay. The service was also nothing outstanding either, including someone having to ask for water on several occasions.	a11zyJN_ue0CQ_bjoeke-w	2	2009-08-03	2	1

It was a great night so it was comfortable, but the overhead lights being so bright it took away from the ambiance.They had specials for the night and their normal menu. One entree was sold out, rigatoni with bolognese which is probably what I would have ordered so I go spaghetti with meatballs. I am not by any means a pasta connoisseur, but this was the best spaghetti and meatballs I have ever had. Perfectly cooked, very tasty and well seasoned sauce and awesome meatballs.Someone came by and offered rolls, they were tasty however dry without anything else. Girlfriend's was a bit burnt. Prices overall are little higher than I would expect.We'll be back, I look forward to trying the chicken parm.	a11zyJN_ue0CQ_bjoeke-w	4	2014-02-16	0	0

I tried the chef salad and the quality was just low. Usually I am an indiscriminate eater, but this salad was just disgusting. Second time I ordered the rigatoni four cheese and a Caesar salad... The pasta doesn't even taste pasta. I am from Italy, and in my opinion, pasta must to be cooked in certain ways. The rigatoni were overcooked and the cheese was bitter and just not good. The Caesar salad wasn't that bad, but neither special.I am disappointed because a friend of mine recommended this place for pasta, but I didn't like it. I am sorry but I won't come back.	a11zyJN_ue0CQ_bjoeke-w	1	2014-10-28	7	0

This restaurant came highly recommended, so we drove 40 minutes to give it a try. David the owner took the time to welcome us to the restaurant, which was a nice change of pace. The food was fresh,  and pasta dishes were amazing! We will  definitely be back soon!	a11zyJN_ue0CQ_bjoeke-w	5	2017-07-09	0	0

I hadn't been to Pasta Brioni in quite some time, but when we were organizing a bachelorette party one of us suggested this place for dinner because of the hot waiters (yeah, I'm just gonna be shallow, and not play coy about that) & its proximity to Old Town. I think they actually offer set menu deals for large parties, but with a group of girls (who may or may not by picky eaters) we didn't take advantage of this. I don't think any of the set menus include alcohol. I had the mushroom risotto & it was fantastic! It was creamy, but not too creamy, and they're was just the right amount of vegetables to risotto. I didn't care that I was amongst all girls, I happily ate the whole thing. Service was fantastic as well! I believe our waiter's name was John (I can't believe I can't 100% remember his name) & he definitely played up the fact this was a bachelorette party group. That being said, all of our orders were correct (except for one minor drink order) and everyone was very happy with the food and service. I should also point out the bachelorette got a special dessert at the end of the night ;)I would definitely come back to Pasta Brioni for any type of meal, but I would especially keep them in mind again for a large dinner party.	a11zyJN_ue0CQ_bjoeke-w	5	2014-05-01	0	1

I was expecting good crusty italian bread for starters. What I got was a hand delivered small roll, neither crusty or warm. My wife commented how it was mealy. It was.My Pasta E Fagioli had a slight vinegar taste and not balsamic vinegar, white vinegar. Yuk.My wife ordered chicken parm with a side of meatballs. The meatballs were just ok. The chicken parm had a good flavor but the presentation looked bad. Sparsely melted cheese that looked like it had just barely melted in a microwave and not the lightly browned cheese evidencing time spent in a hot oven. I had the four cheese rigitoni which was actually pretty good. After the bread, the soup, and the yukky looking chicken parm, we chose not to spend any more $$ on desert. Service and ambiance was above average, but the food wasn't quite what we were hoping for, not for the money anyway. Our search goes on for good Italian in the Phoenix, Scottsdale area.Overall, not a bad place, but for the $$, I'll get a bottle of Rao's sauce, some meatballs from Guidos, and save the grief.	a11zyJN_ue0CQ_bjoeke-w	3	2011-09-28	0	0

Grilled chicken sandwich is my favorite, but have amazing pasta dishes, salads, numerous tasty sandwiches hot and cold. Even the pizza is among my favorites in town. They have a small patio that is not very inviting, and the restaurant is very old and somewhat run down. That's the only reason that I didn't give five stars. Though it's old, it's clean.	a11zyJN_ue0CQ_bjoeke-w	4	2014-11-11	1	0

They've been going there for years and raved about the place..The bread served before the meal was very good and warm. Much to my liking.Before the main meal, we ordered a caesar salad. The salad was good, but nothing exceptional. The salad was by far the least favorite part of the meal. The pasta and pasta sauce was very good. I went with a very basic dish of rigatoni bolganese.  The dish was very good and had lots of food. After filling up on bread, salad and our meal, we couldn't go for dessert, but split one. We had the chocolate ice cream in a hard shell, with hazlenut with whipped cream. The dessert was really good. I couldn't have eaten the dish by myself, but splitting it was a perfect way to end the meal with something on the sweet side.Nice atmosphere in the dining room and bar area. The decor provided a nice ambiance to the evening. Service was very good! The waiter was very attentive to our needs and water was refilled in a prompt manner.I plan on heading back there in the near future and trying other dishes..	a11zyJN_ue0CQ_bjoeke-w	4	2010-07-05	3	0

Went to Pasta Brioni with my mom on Friday and after we were seated our server came over and said, """"Well let's get this show on the road."""" I guess the restaurant was expecting a large party so they didn't want to work before the party arrived. Our server brought us menus finally after he brought two waters and a basket of bread and we were told they only served pizza in the To Go room of the restaurant. I asked the server if we should take our waters over and he said """"Nahhhhhh"""" so I left them there, fully expecting we would be offered water in the separate part of the restaurant. I was wrong. Needless to say I had to ask for plates for our pizza, we were going to dine in but found out they were expecting a large party in that room as well. Right as they were about to bring our pizza and pasta (spaghetti with mushrooms/very little sausage for  $13) we asked if they would just box our food up to go and we left. Bad timing. Mediocre pasta. Decent pizza. But I certainly won't rush back. $30 for poor service, no thank you."""	a11zyJN_ue0CQ_bjoeke-w	3	2016-04-10	0	0

Ordered mussels for my appetizer and they gave a great sized portion- enough to share with the table and all were open and able to be eaten. The pasta alla vodka was incredible.

I think I can speak for both of us when I say we made a great choice in choosing Pasta Brioni. We ate on the lounge side which is very casual and low key. the vibe is like an old school Italian place- Sinatra playing and all. The food, as I expected, was delicious, but more importantly the service was top notch. Our server Brian was really awesome! Prompt, friendly and funny. I'm honestly surprised that anyone would give this place less than 5 stars.... But oh well, more pasta for me because we will definitely be back!!	a11zyJN_ue0CQ_bjoeke-w	5	2016-04-26	0	0

A nice lounge/bar area is vibrant to the left of the entrance.The bread service is awesome - scratch made rolls with a hint of parm and garlic. They were heavy in a good way - a cross between a lighter pretzel roll and either a popover or a brioche roll or maybe 1/3 the way between all three!The eggplant rolatini appetizer can easily be a light entree - with plain noodles it would be a full meal! The ricotta filling was fluffy, light, creamy AND flavorful. So good!The vitello sorrentino was amazing! Tender veal medallions dusted in flour and pan fried with a wine butter sauce.Service was excellent by Leah. They also offer pizzas and calzones mostly at lunch and we would like to try those on our next visit.	a11zyJN_ue0CQ_bjoeke-w	4	2016-08-26	0	1

Memo to Brioni:  there's a craft beer revolution going on and Sam Adams and Blue Moon don't cut it any more.The bread is very good and the linguine pescatore is always a winner.I had an OK experience here but just not as good as I've remembered from past visits over the last 15 years.	a11zyJN_ue0CQ_bjoeke-w	3	2014-07-22	3	1

I would not even call it Italian food. ..I have been to Italy and this food is more Long Island 1960's chef boyardee then anything I ever ate in Italy.  Even the beet salad was terrible.

The place has that old school Italian feel and has a very family feel in the staff.  The visit to our table by one of the owners whom I think started out as a delivery boy? Kitchen help?  Not sure where he started but now as a co-owner he's a symbol of that family business type of venue.  The portions are big and the food is well made and the prices are very good.  The only downside was locating it.  When you're not familiar with the area it's not clear on Google Maps that it's not a stand alone place with roadside visibility.  It's in a shopping center like parking lot and you cannot see it from the street.

We were seated at a table in the bar area right away. Good service. Those rolls that everyone is loving were not warm, and didn't have much flavor. Neither did the olive oil - that was a little bit thin, too. Entree: My escort asked the server if they carry lasagna, which they do, but don't include on the menu """"along with a few other things because there's no room for it on the menu."""" ? I thought this was weird, as it's half a menu: one board with a wine list on one side and food on the other. It doesn't fold like a food menu, it's just the one piece, like a wine list. Maybe I wouldn't have ordered the rigatoni bolognese from the specials board had I had more choices and I wasn't about to make the server stand there and recite all the things they could make for me. Then again, had I done that, I might have found something to eat with a little more ... kick, if you will. I mean, my food was not bad. It was fine. But that's just it - it didn't blow me away. I could have made that and saved (my hot date) a few bucks. I had a glass of pinot from CA that was good. And the entertainment (drunk middle-aged women with an unhealthy obsession with Matt Lauer) was okay. It wasn't the worst meal I ever had, but I won't be returning because it was really no big deal.

Either here or Christos in Phoenix.  It has that formal Chicago/New York Italian feel to it...and I like it a lot.Ambiance aside, the food is the real attraction.

The sandwich is always loaded with the best tasting cutlets, sauce and just enough cheese to keep me happy. At about 10 bucks, based on the size, you should be able to eat one half only for lunch and save the rest. Unfortunately, I have only been able to accomplish that feat once due to not being able to stop eating the addictive food. The pasta salad also makes a nice side dish with it's creamy taste. Great lunch and/or dinner.	a11zyJN_ue0CQ_bjoeke-w	5	2016-07-24	1	0

Great for dining in, but not sure I would recommend the delivery unless you don't mind eating something you didn't order or getting stuck having to go to the store to get your own damn beverages, I mean, how difficult is it to check the order before you leave with it?!?! -_-	a11zyJN_ue0CQ_bjoeke-w	3	2015-03-30	0	0

It was super hot in there, to the point I felt sick. Kind of hurried to get out of there, because of this. They started with water, then brought one roll on a plate to each of us, then our drinks and meal. I ordered the Spaghetti and Meatballs and iced tea and my mom ordered originally the Chx Marsala, but he recommended the Chx Eggplant meal (forgot name) so she got that. Food was pretty good. Nothing too amazing. Bill was $40 almost for two of us. Just expected more for the price of it. Will I go back? Eh? Maybe....	a11zyJN_ue0CQ_bjoeke-w	3	2012-04-11	2	0

The sign isn't the best, but trust me, you need to stop your car and go here STAT! We walked in and it just smelled amazing- that's a good start in my book! We were greeted by a friendly server and given fresh bread (made in house). The bread was phenomenal and soft. It went great with some balsamic, spices and oil dipping sauce.We chose the calamari as an appetizer and two pasta dishes that were equally as delicious and fresh as the bread. I could've kicked myself for not coming here sooner! This place is a gem! The pasta dishes were roughly $18 each and the appetizer was $10, if I remember correctly. Perfectly priced for the large quantity and fresh quality. One of the best parts of the restaurant is that it truly was a gem. It was definitely a place of the locals and not touristy and it was a great vibe for a week night date. The ambiance was lovely and the kitchen, while open, was pretty much quiet.

4	RBZ_kMjowV0t6_nv2UKaDQ	-XH1Q8XWA5upCUWP4riQIQ	"""There's just something about Sunday night and pasta. It goes together like... tomatoes and mozzarella? Last night, I made my way to this neighborhood pasta shop for a family dinner. My meal was spectacular. I ordered the Linguini with seafood and I'm pretty sure the entire ocean was on my plate...in a good way. They brought out the plate of Linguini with all the seafood toppings including squid, shrimp, oysters, clams and probably some fish I couldn't even name for you. At any rate, it was delish! The pasta sauce complimented the fish perfectly and I found myself eating much more of it than I should have. So speaking of seafood, Pasta Brioni accidentally must have merged with a sushi joint last night and they accidentally brought my Mom her halibut more on the """"still swimming"""" side of the plate rather than cooked. When we brought it to the server's attention he was mortified and I will say this... Because of how apologetic the server was, how they handled the situation and how accommodating they were with their mistake, I don't see a reason to have the experience alter my impression of Pasta Brioni. They brought my Mom out a new meal in record time and we were well on our way, after delicious Tiramisu and some chocolate mousse plate of goodness of course!In summary, sometimes it's entirely about how a restaurant handles unfortunate situations. It seemed like the kitchen just had a """"whoops"""" moment and that happens to the best of us, so for that I give them a get out of jail free card. Other restaurants should follow their customer service lead! Plus, I think I might have been in my own food coma of happiness from my own meal. Is it bad that I couldn't wait for my Mom to get her replacement meal and instead scarfed down my personal ocean on a plate? I did give her a little taste as she waited for her own."""	a11zyJN_ue0CQ_bjoeke-w	4	2011-03-08	6	7

Dishes we ordered were a Cesar salad, bolonese, linguine pescatore, penne vodka---all great Italian food!  Deserts were homemade cheesecake, flour less cake and tiramisu that we ordered. Sitting in the bar area at a table was great atmosphere for our ladies laughing and telling stories. The chef stopped by our table and even stayed to chat with us.

1	eiG-SYiCYNe5dyr8XN8NOA	A_XyXrycaEFdnv6Sg1FyIA	I've been coming to this restaurant for about 17 years and I'm still a big fan.  Although it has had some ups and downs, the service and food have always been no less than above par.  Our most recent visit was one of the best I've had in the last past couple of years.  The service was prompt, attentive, and delivered with personality (Mike - great job).  We started off sharing the Beet salad, which was something I've never had before.  The presentation was unique and the flavor, ingredient ratio, and amount were very satisfying.  We ordered the Chicken Parmesan and Chicken Martini as entrees, which I think are some of the best in town without a doubt.  I was so eager to dive in that I forgot to take a picture.  We'll definitely be coming back again soon - more than once.	a11zyJN_ue0CQ_bjoeke-w	4	2015-02-20	1	1

0	XDZaX1izk0aVNaKXLiqhQA	lkHD0mSXkAjoy9qWhFVR5Q	I'll start with the Pros.  My meal was very good I couldn't stop eating it.  Laid back atmosphere.  Server was friendly and put together a meal for my friend that wasn't on the menu.The cons were the portion sizes were massive.  I know in the Italian culture pasta is served in big portions, but I took half of the dish home, and pasta the next day is just not the same.  Since the prices are high and you get what you pay for, I'd rather have a smaller portion with a lower price.  I ordered what I believed to be a side ceaser salad.  That was also huge, seemed like a whole head of lettuce.  It was very tasty, maybe a bit to much dressing that caused it to be not crispy.  It was also disappointing the server didn't offer to crack pepper on the salad and pasta, and offer grated cheese on the pasta.  To be honest, I would have been happy with the bread and salad and I would have been full for 6.50.  Yes, the side salad was 6.50, that was a bit ridiculous.  I had a glass of wine which was wonderful and priced very well.  So I think lowering the prices and the amount of food they give you can set this place over the top.	a11zyJN_ue0CQ_bjoeke-w	3	2010-12-13	0	0
0	zx6gq8IslnAwCyCUztXn1A	-FIrU6r9rgv0sox8C1FiOQ	I've eaten their food at least a dozen times, but have always gotten it To-Go.  Having tried several dishes, I can honestly say the food is decent.  It's not the best I've ever had, but also not the worst.  The sauce is always bland, no matter which dish I order.  I always need to spice it up, once I bring it home.Pricing is okay.  Usually spending around $35 for 2 dishes (my wife and I).  I've never utilized their delivery service, but overheard employees telling customers that they commonly run an hour and a half for delivery.	a11zyJN_ue0CQ_bjoeke-w	3	2011-02-08	1	0

0	UBVW6XBaHRh-F6tbGi7h8g	6cDrE2DGQ8IAz-golP132g	Today the food fell a little short of expectations, I ordered the nightly special which was lobster and shrimp risotto.  The lobster tails were smaller than a typical tail, not a small portion as the dish came with two tails and two shrimp plus the risotto  The reason I mentioned the tail size is it might be a variety I have not had before, the lobster had a great grilled taste but had a texture that was not what was expected , not the buttery softness I associate with lobster (overcooked?). The risotto was cooked to the right consistency but could have used more butter and cream (or what it is they use to make risotto delicious)  I'm guessing the chef didn't taste this batch before it went out.  The staff was great, our server was Jason or Thomas. 4 stars based on years of patronage and have always experienced excellent service and quality food with today's exception on the food missing the mark..	a11zyJN_ue0CQ_bjoeke-w	4	2016-03-20	1	0

Our waiter seemed aloof, and then after a while he started getting it together. One thing I really didn't appreciate was the fact that when we got there they sat us by the door to the outside patio (which at the time was closed). After a while someone propped the door open and it was extremely cold. I asked the host (some guy with little man syndrome) if they could close the door, he annoyingly said """"Nope, can't do it we have people outside.""""

He implored us to come see him for lunch the following day, """"we were going to love it"""". What a mistake. The food was slightly better than Olive Garden. We walked in and there was nobody to greet us, we wandered past the kitchen and asked the cook if they were open. Our server was working the place by himself, it took FOREVER for any service. There was one other table in the place beside us, and it was slooooooooooooow.Well over an hour for lunch, with four people in our party, and one other couple in the restaurant. No lunch prices, just a dinner menu, I spent 27 dollars plus tip for a bowl of pasta and a glass of iced tea. (great rolls though.) The owner never bothered to come out and say hello, or thank us for coming to his restaurant. How they have stayed in business as long as they have is beyond me."""	a11zyJN_ue0CQ_bjoeke-w	2	2015-11-11	0	0

Our shrimprisotto was more like shrimp and wild rice and the linguini pesto chicken needed salt to bring out the flavor and I never salt my food. Disappointing food in both our meals. Maybe other dishes are better but it will be a long time before we go again to find out.

He said sorry.  33% HIGHER price for drinks AND food  3 feet from the bar.  IDIOTIC!  We went to Roaring Fork, nicer place, pub tables, lower prices for drinks & food at their happy hour.

Delicious, rich, cooked perfectly. Huge portion. Had more than enough to take home for another meal. My wife had the eggplant lasagna. Very good. Had the cannoli for dessert. Probably the best I've ever eaten. Why only four stars?  The waiter was completely disinterested. He came over and asked if we were ready to order. When we hesitated for a couple of seconds, he immediately said he'd come back later. Really?After our meal was served, he never returned to ask how our meal was. Or to refill our water glass. Now, this wasn't some college student. It was apparent he was one of the managers as he was dressed in a sleeves rolled up shirt and slacks. We would go back again as this is one of the few restaurants in the Phoenix area that knows how to cook real Italian food that's also delicious and plentiful.	a11zyJN_ue0CQ_bjoeke-w	4	2017-03-23	0	0

But like most things.. you kinda just have to experience it yourself no matter what others say. Well the funny thing is I went to the cafe side which was completely empty and the menu was pretty sparse compared to the website, so right then I was disappointed and wished my date wasnt on his way to meet me there......UNTIL my date found me and brought me to the """"other side"""" which was jam packed and full of energy.. not to mention offering an extensive menu. Yay and thank god! it turns out the other side is more of the """"to go"""" side. Okay so the rolls came out and they werent awful but they weren't warm and doughy which is what i had expected from other reviews.. but that was okay. If they had been warm and doughy I would have eaten 10 so it was actually a better situation. We started with the caprese salad which they automatically split on 2 separate plates, which I thought was great initiative. I have to say that was probably the BEST Caprese I have ever had. Those tomatoes were unspeakably good! To follow I ordered the Antipasta salad it was perefect I had no complaints whatsoever. My date had a seafood pasta, I cant remember which one and he wasn't moaning over it but he definitely didn't complain. So I guess it all depends on what you order..maybe. But I was pleased enough to return sometime and try something else, no question."""	a11zyJN_ue0CQ_bjoeke-w	3	2009-10-09	1	1
0	PwXZTe-yUmohxQVcKX21UQ	IAA1UWzzgxEkguO7dYHidw	We were visiting the Phoenix area from Indianapolis wanted to find a great Italian restaurant for my Mother in law's birthday.  We chose Pasta Brioni  based on the Yelp reviews.  I have to say that our party of six had one of the worst dinning experiences of our lives.  The location is incredibly difficult to find but after driving around it for 20 minutes we found it.  We had made a reservation and were seated immediately, which I thought was great considering they were pretty full.   This is where the service stopped.We were sat without menus for 10 minutes.  Once we had menus we waited another 10 minutes for the waiter to return and give us their specials.  Each time the waiter came to our table he would say a few words and then immediately turn and quickly leave, not asking if we had any questions or God forbid if we would like a drink.  A member of our party asked the man helping and serving bread and water about a menu item.  He refused to answer only stating that he would get the waiter.  After reading the menu for 15 minutes our waiter returned to take our order.  He took our food order and turned and left.  I had to snap my fingers to get his attention when he was about 10 feet away from our table to get him to come back and finally take our drink order.  Once we had our drinks we toasted to the birthday girl during which I spilled my drink.  I quickly got up and located my waiter notified him of what had happened.  He looked like a deer in headlights and asked me what we should do.  I asked for something to clean it with and was handed a few extra napkins.  Back at the table, drink cleaned up and waiting again this time 30 minutes for our dinner.The manager? or host?  apologized and stated our meals would be out shortly.Once the meals arrived the food was good, not the best Italian I have ever had but by no means the worst either.  Definitely not worth the time that it took to receive it.My rating is based solely on the terrible service we received and that we had to try and chase down our waiter to get anything done.	a11zyJN_ue0CQ_bjoeke-w	1	2013-04-20	0	0
0	lH7Cog9mtHc2mJvpCzECog	2kxXNGXwPntMtkky9WXUUQ	I am very pleased with my experience at Pasta Brioni. Definitely on the pricey side but I was taking my girlfriend to dinner on Valentine's day so that it was a special occasion. It was evident that the staff was working in a very stressful environment with almost every seat filled but I was impressed with their professionalism and friendliness regardless. The environment was beautiful as we were seated outside (thanks to the beautiful Arizona weather). Our waiter was very friendly. He was very helpful and made pleasant conversation. Many of the staff was interactive with the people and seemed to legitimately have fun in doing their job. The food was just as amazing as the service. I got the penne vodka with chicken and a garden salad. She got the rigatoni pasta with meatballs and a Ceasar salad. AMAZING. Paid 65 including a 15 dollar tip. Overall they helped make our Valentine's day experience amazing and this business deserved all the credit in the world for their amazing food and professionalism. I am a huge fan.

3	QwOSC30OYmjUCpczgEInAw	lgBxVF5pildWB1sIglUpgQ	The stars are for service only as the manager and owner was extremely accommodating and did not charge us for the food we could not eat.. So that's the good part but you must be wondering Hope why would you go to a restaurant to not eat food?! Crazy I know, but the food was just that awful we could not force it down ! I ordered a few rolls and asked for cream cheese to be added because I like the creamy taste mixed with flavorful fish .. Keyword is flavorful . This tasted like eating a stick of cream cheese wrapped in rice, nothing else had Any flavor !! When I explained to the manager she tried to say well you added cream cheese and now you're complaining it tastes like cream cheese , fair point if there was nothing else in the roll, however a tiny amount of it should not completely over power everything else, don't blame the poor cream cheese dude, blame your lousy quality tasteless fish! We tried sashimi too and it literally had no taste on its own. The pork Gyoza was the only thing that tasted normal .. Speaking of which we asked for spicy mayo and if you have had sushi anywhere you know it's pretty thin and spicy. This was just regular thick globby mayo with probably food coloring as it was not spicy at all! Also their drinks were Flat and when I pointed it out I was told that's not possible it was just changed today ! Seriously you guys with broken taste buds stop leading us astray! Sushi station which is a revolving sushi bar tastes like 20x better than here, we went there after we left here since we only had a few bites each and were still hungry !

0	cZnnCd2X_k4iVUH_Z-CoGw	65VdciGFwz0RjoiDCFTehg	When I rate a sushi place, first and foremost importance in my criteria is the fish itself. Everything else falls into palace after that. This is where Hana excels. The fish is extremely fresh and well cut. Hamachi sashimi is about as good as I've had in AZ. I throughly enjoyed the sashimi salad as well - tons of fresh fish mixed in with nice greens and tasty dressing. As for everything else, service is good enough, pace of kitchen is satisfactory. Nothing mind blowing here, but all good enough to keep coming back. Waitstaff is friendly. They hurry you a bit sometimes but it does get busy often so it's somewhat understandable. Overall a great place for fresh quality sushi and the byob is great as you can save the markup on a great bottle of sake or wine. Sushi: excellentService: friendly, satisfactoryAmbiance: neighborhood joint. Nothing fancy, not a dump thoughPrice: very fair for some stuff, a bit overpriced for others.

0	HdOMMT-x4R_HRpSgjRnoug	_GDG8Z1sUD_xc8d8lOZKwA	"""At last, a sushi bar that isn't a hot spot, and isn't completely devoid of atmosphere. It is the perfect balance -- clean, but comfortable, sophisticated, yet friendly. What's more, the food is EXCELLENT.I have been there three times so far, and I have yet to find complaint with the food. The sushi is fresh and fantastic. Hana orders whole fish, straight from the coast. The ahi I had was glossy and ruby red; the flavor delicate. It had the perfect texture, with just enough """"give,"""" so that one does not struggle with biting it, and not so soft that it lacks substance. It was also a generous portion, draped over a small, but flavorful rice ball.Their tempura has lovely and light batter, and it enrobes fresh, crisp veggies, and sweet, tender shrimp. The miso soup is also good, and they don't hold back on the goodies. For once, I found that tofu can have flavor!When I ordered the bento, it was filled with all sorts of treats! Some I could not even identify. I am embarrassed to say, I was well and truly stuffed, when I finished eating it all. Surprisingly, the prices are very reasonable! Nigiri goes for about $3-$5, maki about $5-$10, noodle dishes $80-$10, and entrees $12-$15. I have only been during lunch time, so I don't know if these change for dinner.That all said, since it is brand-spanking new, and its staff is still learning the ropes, Hana struggles a bit with service. Sometimes entrees come out poorly-timed. Sometimes you have to wait for your dishes to be cleared. You might get a bit thirsty, waiting for your refill.But it is worth it. It is so worth it.

The menu offers a selection that's more authentic than typical American-inspired """"teriyaki chicken and rice"""" styled eateries. First on my list is the sushi, which really might be the best in the Valley. Hanna opts for minalistic perfection, offering a variety of high quality, melt-in-your-mouth nigiri, and a few foundation rolls, the albacore being especially noteworthy. Secondly, the atmosphere is genuine, with a packed bistro and sushi bar or outdoor deck--yes, a deck! We ordered clams, octopus tempora, pork ramen, and a sashimi bento. I wasn't blown away by the ramen, but then the price didn't blow up our wallets either. Maybe I'm just not that into noodles. All other items were a smash hit."""

9	p_azadim_uWFOXAhhKB3ag	m8s701LF2mRgTjCCkqRtYg	What's raw, slick and makes you feel good all over? It's sushi! From trendy scenester food to its current mainstay presence, sushi has been a part of the dining scene for ages. Even with time this time spent, sushi is still very much exciting to enjoy.For me, Hana Japanese Eatery puts the amore in enamored and the fat into infatuated.With a solid menu of offerings and loads of daily specials there's plenty to keep things fresh and engaging. When I'm eating my way through the valley, almost 8 out of 10 Ill order the special when offered. In this experience Ive been able to try amazing off menu items that were seasonal or the chef was feeling whimsy that day.Not to whimsy but fully fun and interactive, Edamame ($3.95) is always a must for me. There's just something about biting into each pod and sucking the soy beans out that I find satisfying.Like something out of a dream, the sashimi, nigiri, and rolls were served on a small boat. This beautiful presentation just goes to show how attention to detail goes well beyond the food. Such things like wasabi get special attention, Hana's pickled version will make you quickly forget about the traditional paste variety. Putting the wasabi to good use, the Blue Fin ($20/$20) was ordered 2 ways, sashimi and seared, the first being my favorite, each bite almost felt like eating butter, that tender. Such favorites as Octopus ($10) and Crab Nigiri ($5) were as pretty as they were delicious.Loving rolls with contrast and crunch the Shrimp Tempura Roll ($8.50) filled both counts easily. However its special cousin, the Lobster Roll ($20), takes a California roll then is adorned with large pieces of battered quick fried lobster meat, no skimping on the good stuff here.Hot dishes on the specials menu are expertly prepared. Scallop Edamame ($10.95) takes the sweet tenderness of scallops, then is battered and rolled in soy beans and lightly fried. The texture of the buttery soy beans meshed well with the sweetness of the scallop, a must. More special menu love was felt with the sauteed Giant Clam with Scallops ($16.95). Tempura Udon ($9.95) was ordered off of the regular menu and let me tell you, those chewy noodles are simply addicting.Ive never heard the words Japanese and pizza in the same sentence before. So after our server described the Okonomiyaki ($18.95), it had to be ordered. More like a thick savory pancake in taste but the looks of a pizza, this was certainly a surprise by taste and by oddity. The top of the Okonomiyaki is sprinkled with bonito flakes which move and quiver when exposed to heat. So when it was sat down in front of me I couldn't help but stare at the movement. Yes, I was a little freaked out but how cool is that?Hana An Mitsu ($6.95) was the most perfect ending for the style of cooking. This refreshing dessert made up of aloe vera and was accompanied by oranges, blueberries & red bean paste, reminded me of an exotic fruit cocktail. If chewy and creamy intrigue you try the Ichigo Mochi Ice Cream ($4.95). The chewy rice mochi shell encapsulates your choice of ice cream, very different and tasty.Hana doesn't serve alcohol but feel free to bring your own wine, beer or sake, they wont charge you a corking fee, which makes that scallop even sweeter.

3	WnuA7ijDeUQGTp4QBqiSbg	p1XYU6v11G2k05oyWpKlWA	I've had better was what kept repeating through my head throughout dinner. Everything at Hana was decent, but nothing stood out as spectacular.Perhaps the Chef saves the best ingredients and extra effort for the daily specials, but he certainly didn't spend much time on the bento box, which is my go to when checking out any Japanese restaurant for the first time as if gives you a 'tasting menu' of what the restaurant has to offer. We also had a side of vegetable gyoza.The Good:  - the Salmon sashimi was quite good, fresh and flavorful- the tempura was great, light and crisp- the pickled vegetables were a nice addition to the standard bento fare. - the white ginger was nice and refreshing, a step up from the standard pink ginger at most sushi places.- great neighborhood vibe - small and intimate with a modern Asian vibe than isn't overly 'faux-Japanese' or 'trendy'- quick, friendly serviceThe Not so Good- the tuna sashimi tuna had the telltale mushy flavorless that comes from being previously frozen) - the 'chef's choice' sashimi (A white fish, but we didn't get a chance to ask what it was) was flavorless (although not mushy!)- the California rolls were quite disappointing - imitation crab meat and over mayo-ed (why do California rolls even need mayo?)- the wasabi lacked kick. (I'll be sure to ask for fresh if I visit again)- the gyoza tasted like the came pre-made and frozen.One comment on the BYOB.  While I usually like the idea of BYOB, (especially with no corkage fees), at a Japanese restaurant, i usually like ordering Sake or Japanese beer that can be hard to come at regular retail outlet in Phoenix).Overall, the experience wasn't memorable.  I may come back when the sushi urge hits (and order off the daily special menu), but it won't be a priority otherwise, especially with all the great other restaurants popping up in uptown Phoenix.

The place is small, so get there early if not be prepared to wait for a table.  I ordered the gyoza (Japanese Pan steamed dumplings), I was pretty good.  For my entrée, I ordered the Hana Katsu (Golden breaded chicken breast infused with Koso butter).  Wow, it was good...  Lightly breaded, fried just right, chicken was juicy, and Koso butter was a good touch of flavor.  For my dessert, I got the cream filled tempura (cream lightly battered to a golden crunch).  It was done just perfect.  The service was pretty good, she double check our orders maybe due to a language barrier, but either way our order came out perfect.

Expect a 20-40 minute wait on weekends as its popular among the locals. Owned privately and well managed, the service was impeccable. The table was frequently cleaned and maintained by anyone in the vicinity. The Sushi was fresh, mild and tender as should be. I would give 5 stars except for the host and hostess lack of attention to the wait list. We waited 50min instead of the 20 we were told. They just overlooked us.

This is Hana Japanese Eatery on 7th St.Corkage, byob!This is my favorite sushi/japanese restaurant in town right now.  Unfortunately they do not serve alcohol, but you can bring your own sake, wine or beer (just stop at AJ's on Camelback and Central on your way in).  Incredibly fresh and delicious sashimi and sushi, always fabulous specials on the board, and interesting items like fresh halibut or red striped bass really make for some great sashimi.  Service can be excellent to horrible (had a very bad server at lunch once) but is normally excellent, this is a family run business and the Japanese influence is seen in the fabulous dishes.  Make sure you order your favorite sushi rolls or sashimi, even if it isn't on the short menu.  They are glad to make anything you ask for if they have it available.  I had one of the best salmon skin handrolls i've had anywhere in the world here.  And the tuna tataki with crunchy roasted garlic was out of this world.  I'm a sashimi lover but these specials on the board have to be ordered because they are that good.   One night they had a special seaweed with lemon peel and green onions that I will order any time I see it available, amazing flavor and texture, very japanese.  mmmm.Not open for lunch on Saturday or Sunday, closed on Mondays.  Regular hours through the week.	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	5	2007-08-18	2	1

There was also ample space in the parking lot.I had the Hana Bento Box, which could easily have feed two people! You begin with miso soup and a small salad, and then the box arrives, overflowing with food. In the box is a delicious assortment of vegetables, an assortment of tempura vegetables and shrimp (the batter was so light and crispy and perfect, the vegetables were a wonderful assortment, and both the shrimp & the veggies were perfectly cooked), 6 pieces of different sashimi, a California roll, and a slice of orange. My only regret is that I didn't take a picture because it was phenomenal!Thanks Hana--I'll be back!	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	5	2016-08-12	0	0

HOWEVER there are 2 sushi restaurants in Phoenix named Hana and they are NOT the same.The one you should end up at is called Hana Japanese Eatery and is located at 5524 N 7th Ave Phoenix. It is NOT the Hana Sushi located #3, 602 West Union Hills Drive  Phoenix, AZ 85027. We found this out the hard way after Googling Hana and driving to the wrong location.We realized right away we were at the wrong Hana and left immediately to find the right one.Glad we did as the Sushi at Hana Japanese Eatery was some of the best we have eaten in a long time. Rolls were unique, large, an very fresh! Service was excellent as well and prices very fair for the high quality Sushi that arrived on our table. Also one of the best Miso soups wee have had in a long time. Our absolute favorites of the rolls we ordered were  the Spicy Tuna hand rolls and the Baked Salmon roll. Just incredible! A first for us as well was that along with the standard Wasabi Paste you get at every Sushi joint, you also get fresh chopped Wasabi plant. It looks like relish when they serve it, but it's actual Wasabi plant. It's fiery hot and really awesome on the sushi. It is clear why this place is rated highy by Zagat and well reviewed. Amazing and Fresh Sushi with great service!! 5 Stars well deserved.	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	5	2012-10-15	0	0

It was home. I loved the people and the culture. The way the earth and the ocean offer the other balance there. The night life and let us not forget ever, the food. Well Hana is not it... :PBut it is still pretty damn good. I love coming here with my mom. I am always trying to push her to eat something new! She is typical fraidy cat and wont hardly touch sashimi which is delicious here. One piece and she's out. I have ordered tuna tataki here (one of my favourite meals in the world) but I don't think it is on the menu, and for me they over sear the fish. I like it just lightly fire kissed. The rolls here are pretty typical. Avocado and cream cheese to satisfy my mother and cover up any real flavor of the fish. The miso is really very good here. Its always hit or miss with miso in the states... Usually extremely too salty, but here has always been good. The tempura platters are shazaam! Fun and delicioso. In conclusion, i suggest you give it a try. Don't forget to bring your own booze, an empty tummy, and an open mind!	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	4	2013-01-03	9	8
0	-VBZn4i4crMhi-bn-jR_cg	0WHCesvMAFx22Jeqxsrqmw	I'm a huge Japanese cuisine and Sushi connoisseur so I had to write a review after the amazing lunch today at Hana.  Hana is not your typical Japenese restaurant, it's the real deal and offers an extensive menu.  A few of the items we ordered were the Salmon & Albacore Sashimi and it was so fresh.  They provide both fresh and wasabi spread which is wonderful.  Their Albacore was truly some of the best I've ever had which was topped with browned scallions, and avocado slices. Hana is Japenese owned and operated restaurant which explains the attention to detail, as well as the amazing menu.  Rick, their Sushi chef prepared our sushi and it was beautifully prepared, as well incredibly fresh.  I also want to give a shout out to our waiter today, Jake, who took great care of us and did a really great job providing us with some really wonderful recommendations. It's alway so nice when the wait staff knows the menu.  I was also pleased to find out that Hana also offers BYOB, and even provides a wine bucket and glasses. I will have already recommended Hana to many of my friends and this will definitely be one of my regular places to eat.	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	5	2016-12-22	0	0

0	icerWtPCrYx0bPdtPbVZOQ	o7Pe-pMe8ETwp18LhWrK9A	Hana is the only Japanese restaurant I will eat sushi in Phoenix. Their prices are quite reasonable, and the quality and freshness is always exemplary. I dine in sometimes, but I often get it to go, since I live nearby. It's pretty busy in the nights, especially the weekend. The nigiri and sashimi are my favorites on the menu. My usual run to Hana includes eel nigir, tuna sashimi, yellowtail sashimi, and sometimes salmon sashimi. They are very generous on their cuts of sashimi, and I don't feel ripped off as I have at other restaurants with paper thin slices of fish. They are always mindful if you have any food allergies and will ask you up front if you have any. So all you lactose-intolerant folks, definitely check out this place. Expect to pay around $40 for a nice amount of sushi, but you will leave satisfied and know you're paying for fresh and great quality food.	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	5	2013-10-21	2	1

Traditionally, proprietors shout this to you as you walk in to their establishment in Japan and Hana is no exception. As a Japanese native, I have very fond memories of how my food tasted while I was growing up. So far, there are only two restaurants I've tried in Arizona that have traditional sushi and dishes unique to Japanese home style cuisine. Hana is one of them.Sushi is meant to be eaten in a single bite. Unlike most sushi restaurants in America, the chefs prepare the fish for nigiri sushi/sashimi thin and tender. This is how it is in Japan! Not the chunky block of fish you usually get. Sure, you feel like you are getting more value for your dollar but the whole idea around Japanese cuisine is balance, taste and esthetics. Too much fish overpowers the delicate flavor of the seasoned rice. Either way, their sushi is always fresh and delicious and creative. While cream cheese is not widely used in Japan, you can still get your Americanized sushi if you want it so you get a nice balance between authentic and neo-cuisine. I highly recommend any of their nigiri options (slice of fish on top of a bite of seasoned rice). We've tried a few of their rolls too and were not disappointed.My favourite dish is their Tonkatsu Ramen. It is sort of off-menu; you have to request it. And it is amazing. The broth is a rich pork broth, made from boiling pork bones for literally hours and hours. The noodles are tender with a wonderful chewy-ness to them and the garnishments are wonderful. Takes me back to my childhood, slurping soup out of the bowl from a tiny shoppe in an alley, steaming my face in the rich aroma of pork. A recent trip to Japan reminded me of just how much I love that dish and Hana does it up right. In fact, they've won awards for their Ramen! Best in Arizona!They also have some of the best Tempura available! Tender, light and delicious. I have yet to have a greasy tempura dish set before me from Hana. Try their Agedashi Tofu - Tofu squares battered, deep fried and then served with a light tempura sauce poured over. The batter turns gummy (in the best possible way), the tofu is piping hot (as in, be careful!) and the flavor is delicate and comforting. Oh! And the Hamachi Kama (this is the collar of the Yellowtail fish) is out of this world. Broiled perfectly so that the meat has a nice char but is still tender and moist. Served with a traditional ponzu (soy-citrus) sauce. YUM! (I'm making myself hungry!)Other traditional Japanese dishes are offered from their """"Japanese Menu"""". It isn't always handed to you at the table. Sometimes you have to ask for it. Most of the items found on this menu are visible on the chalkboard above the sushi bar too. Be sure to try them! They're terrific. I recommend the Takoyaki (little balls of seasoned dumpling, stuffed with cooked octopus and then topped with Kewpie Mayonnaise and other delicious toppings) and the cold soba (cold buckwheat noodles that you dip in a subtle soy/ponzu sauce.) Wonderful in Summer and surprisingly hearty for such a light dish!. Their main dinner menu features steak, chicken and lobster prepared in their own Hana style. It's pretty yummy but I admit that I tend to stick to the more traditional stuff. Price-wise, they are within the typical range for a Japanese eatery. My husband and I typically spend around $50-60 for dinner but he eats a LOT of sushi so...The staff is always friendly, enthusiastic and attentive. The place really has good food so don't be surprised if there is a wait. It is a small place (they are expanding soon) so there are a limited number of tables. But they turn their tables around rather quickly so typically your wait is not longer than 30-40 minutes on a very busy Friday evening.  This is a BYOB establishment. You bring your beer, sake or wine and they'll uncork it for you and provide fresh glasses. My only complaint (and this is entirely a ME thing) is that it can get rather loud in there. I'm accustomed to the quiet atmosphere you find in Japan but not at Hana. I'm sure it is just because so many people are talking so enthusiastically about how delicious the food is! Footnote: My daughter is deathly allergic to shellfish but loves sushi. I like that this restaurant routinely asks about food allergies every time we order and they are careful to keep shellfish well away from her order so we can all enjoy without having to worry if we'll have to cart her to the ER!"""

2	Y_2jMUKz6pvJ0JSWG3u10A	aVTZKYkASsgA2acwp6rvcw	"""I used to love this place but now we go more out of habit. We got take-out there the other night for a light meal and managed to spend $30 on a regular spicy tuna roll, a specialty roll and side of steamed rice. $30 seriously? And the specialty roll was only 6 pieces which was disappointing given the cost. Looks like Hana is starting to cut back with prices staying steady or increasing. A sign in the front alerts patrons who want to split checks that there will be a $1.50 charge on each bill """"given the recent economy."""" I find that pretty unbelievable. Anyways, the food is generally pretty good. One of my favorites is their Hana salad although I was pretty disappointed when they began layering the bottom of the salad with iceberg lettuce instead of the usual mix. Again with the cut-backs. Don't get me wrong. I like Hana alot but I think they are becoming overpriced for food that is good but in an average way comparable to other Asian spots."""	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	3	2010-04-13	5	2

Everyone raved about the sea bass and salmon sashimi.  The fried oyster appetizer was crispy and tasty.  Also loved the tofu appetizer -- delicately fried chunks of soft tofu in a soy broth.  I love the old school boats for serving the sushi.  My favorite option was the spicy tuna roll, which was actually spicy and not slathered in mayo like most sushi bars in town.  It's BYOB, and they don't have a corkage fee.  I'll definitely be going back!	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	5	2008-04-12	3	1

0	Up5reJmuM7a4lMz46KhngA	BiqtKg_narexv5nF9CucsQ	This is my favorite Sushi Spot in Phoenix. I see Sushi Chefs from other restaurants coming here to eat during their off time. =)The prices are very reasonable, and all of the rolls and sashimi are very fresh and crafted to perfection by the old timers.The Ramen Noodle Bowl is awesome, and nothing like what you would buy in the grocery store. It is topped with pork, fish cake, bamboo, and seaweed. I highly recommend.They even have a fried salmon skin roll, which was very flavorful and not always available at every establishment. I wish that i would have taken a picture of the last one that I purchased, it was absolutely perfect.They also offer Takoyaki, which is like an octopus dumpling ball. You would have no idea that it contained octopus unless you were familiar with the dish. these are absolutely amazing and highly addictive. You have to try these during your visit.The last time that I was there, I had to try the Ichigo Mochi Ice Cream. It was green tea ice cream, surrounded by a rice flour shell and topped with whipped cream. It really hit the spot and I was so full but in a happy and satisfying way.If you like Sushi, and you think that RA is cool, hit yourself on the head for being a complete fool and go check this place out and get schooled on what fresh authentic Sushi is all about. Your mouth will thank you for doing the right thing!Cheers and keep up the good work at the place.FYI... Bring your own Saki if you need booze with your meal. I say, just enjoy the good meal without alcohol and see how happy and relaxed the meal makes you feel.	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	5	2011-12-28	5	1

It's a small, cozy restaurant with tables for 3-4, for 2, and seats at the sushi bar. We ordered the vegetarian gyoza as our appetizer and two cups of miso soup. We also got the Philly roll and Las Vegas roll, and the former came out first out of all the food. I love a classic Philly roll, can't go wrong with cream cheese and salmon. The Vegas roll was okay, I'm just not a fan of the deep fried rolls. The soup was excellent, simple but satisfying. And the appetizer was pretty good as well. They brought us more pickled ginger when we asked, since we like that stuff a lot. Good service, they are fast and efficient at refilling water and clearing off empty plates. Partly because the place is so small and they were getting more customers. Once we paid our bill, we felt that we had to leave because groups of two were waiting and there were no empty tables for 2. Still a great place to check out and I liked the authentic feel of it.	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	4	2016-08-07	15	13

0	NSUjtynUgUugvjyKeGn_jw	s5LfGvGqd3ioZ7t2417WiA	Hana has been one of the restaurants in our bucket list. My husband and I had the opportunity to go here. I really wanted to like this place but just bummed and came home unhappy and unsatisfied.We ordered gyoza, ginger pork lunch bento, salmon terriyaki lunch bento and a volcano sushi. Total bill was about $39 and some change.The gyoza was actually pretty good. I wish we could have gotten 2 orders and be done with it. I had the ginger pork, I pretty much had about 8 thinly sliced bite size pork hidden within some onions and ginger. My husband had a really small salmon. The side dishes were boiled potato, okra, squash and something else - I am not sure what it is. Underwhelmed and still a bit hungry, we ordered the volcano. I'm a little disappointed as it wasn't what I am used to. The only fish I found was the fish on the very top, that's it.Overall, it was an underwhelming and unsatisfying lunch. I wish we have gone somewhere else. Not going back and can't recommend it.	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	1	2015-05-05	1	0

I made sure to order a wide variety of items to make sure I captured the gist what they were putting down.First up: Miso SoupVery good flavor lots of seaweed, tofu, and seasonings.2nd: Tuna TartareThinly sliced, a little smokiness, a little acidity but a bit disappointing overall.  It was lacking the pop I look for in this dish.3rd: Octopus ballsThese were interesting.  Deep fried octopus with some mayo and a light sauce.  Good flavor but the cold middle just didn't work for my palate at all.4th: Shrimp and Veggie tempuraPerfectly breaded tempura.  Light crisp and tasteful.  Only knock was the dipping sauce was too simple and plain5th: Phili RollIt's hard to make a really bad or really good Phili roll.  This was just as good as any in my book.6th: Tuna sashimiUnimpressed with the freshness, mouthfeel, and color.  Expected much better pieces from such a highly regarded sushi joint.Hana has a good ambiance.  Service started out good but kind of faded midway thru.  The price was average to high for the fare. I understand lots of people love them and as much as I wanted to be in on that love fest I'm just not one of them and I am okay with that.  As overall both visits were just okay for me.  Wasn't great...wasn't bad...just really okay.  It is hard to see me giving them a third chance unless I am really craving ok sushi...	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	3	2016-03-21	3	1
0	MFGDwMQJijNc0mHv1s_BUQ	gWWFG6AcxKb8NIC_KA3a6g	I had a craving for sushi and a friend who wanted to try this place because a friend of his is a chef here.  It was the perfect combination!  Since it was a Friday night I suggested we get there early-ish to try and get a table quickly so we arrived around 5:30.  The place is pretty small so most of the tables were full but we managed to get seated right away.My friend decided that he was going to order everything  so I knew dinner was definitely not going to be some Philly rolls and fried rice.  We started out with seaweed salad which I actually really liked.  The flavor was really good with the sesame seeds and some lemon.  Next was the sushi, we had the Alaskan roll, Spicy Tuna, Volcano roll and some Sea Bass nigiri.  The Alaskan and Spicy Tuna were good, the Volcano roll was awesome with it's spicy sauce nicely crusted on top and the Sea Bass was simple and delicious.After that it was time for me to try Oysters for the first time.  Personally I wasn't a big fan but that has nothing to do with Hana and everything to do with just my personal preference.  I could tell the quality was good and they didn't taste gross, I just discovered that Oysters aren't my thing.Now at this point we were pretty full but the chef my friend knew walked by and told him to get the Razor Clams and/or the Tako Karaage.  Neither of us knew what the second one was so we asked and discovered it was fried octopus head.  As soon as he told us that I knew that's what my friend was going to order.  I'll admit I was a little nervous because I was picturing something with eyeballs coming out onto the table.  Luckily when they brought it to the table it was cut into strips so it looked completely harmless.  We drizzled some lemon over it, took a deep breath and took a bite.  After about 2 seconds we looked at each other in amazement because it was DELICIOUS!!!  I'm talking so good my mouth is watering just remembering it right now.  Octopus has a tendency to get chewy but this had a texture like steak!  The flavor of it was amazing as well.  The lemon juice gave it just the right balance of citrus and whatever they marinated it in before frying it was perfect.  Definitely the highlight of the meal.For desert we asked the waitress for her recommendation and she suggested the Hana An Mitsu which is aloe vera with fruit and red bean paste.  I wasn't quite sure about eating aloe vera as I associate it with putting it on my skin for a sun burn but we decided to continue our adventure of trying new things and get it.  It came out almost like a soup, there were big chunks of the aloe, a couple strawberries, some mandarin oranges and the chunky red bean paste all in a liquid of some kind.  Neither of us were really big fans, the aloe chunks were just too big and overpowered the rest of it.  Overall though the meal was one of the best I've had.  The quality and flavors of the food was excellent.	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	5	2013-07-16	3	0
4	M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA	K7P3DLZ_mWtxjCqb318_jw	Ate here months ago.  Was excited to finally find a Phoenix sushi venue, and one that also offered brown rice as a sub for sushi dishes (don't quote me on this however, since it has been many months and I may be recalling another venue).  One item did impress me, and that was the complimentary appetizer that was comprised of tempura'd chips with perhaps a squid salad topping (?)  I should have just ordered another serving of this!  Instead, I tried an Ao Yasai (mixed gourmet greens with ginger) and a sushi roll w/ brown rice, the latter I thought was price-y considering the very small portion given.  I was so unimpressed by its unexciting flavors that I don't even recall what kind of roll I tried!  Pretty sad, I know.  I told myself I wouldn't go back, but I would like to give Hana another try, perhaps for lunch and/or dinner with a group of friends and have apps and wine/sake!

Everytime I've gone, the staff has been super friendly and the sushi is terrific.  When it first opened, they used to bring out all sushi orders on those big boats, which I found kinda funny because sometimes there would only be two orders on there but they'd still make a huge presentation out of it.They don't seem to do that anymore, at least not with the smaller orders.  I kinda miss that.  Maybe they don't have enough boats or something.  ;)	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	5	2008-06-17	5	3

Surprisingly, a lot of locals are unaware of this gem. I feel like people want to keep it a secret because it's just that good! I recommend Hana to everyone asking for sushi recommendations. I've been to Hana dozens of times and have spent 3 birthdays there. I always order the volcano roll no matter what. It's so delicious. Baked to perfection! The spicy tuna roll is delicious as well. Honestly, anything on the menu is great. The staff is always helpful and they never get annoyed even after asking a millllion questions. I love visiting Hana. The one thing I truly miss in Phoenix. Ps it's BYOB. Doesn't get much better.	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	5	2015-06-30	0	0

Brought an extremely picky foodie friend visiting and he loved this place.  Loved the dumplings, toro sashimi, yellowtail sashimi and mackarel sashimi.  What I didn't realize the last time I ate here when I spouted off about limited sushi selection, is that they have several sushi specials which more or less doubles their offerings.  New favorite sushi place.  Seriously, get over there!	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	5	2010-05-03	1	2

The waitstaff was incredibly friendly and attentive, and the food was outstanding - the fish was fresh as can be (despite being far from water) - and the noodles and salad were tastefully done. I've heard there's oftentimes a wait (they are small and don't take reservations), but we went after the lunch rush and didn't have a problem. Some of the best Japanese I've had!

The location of Hana is perfect and parking can be found quite easily.  ** Just an fyi - They have recently applied for a Liquor License and we were informed that during the process, they are not permitted to be a BYOB business.The sushi is always fresh, good portions and attentive service from everyone.  Go early or later to avoid standing around watching everyone eat.  They do have a small outdoor patio, it was too cold for us though.	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	4	2013-12-12	3	1
1	kT8PCNJ3RnBXHJEZCaM5_w	0kSwpWQaXJWbN_25XMbYbw	I went to Hana last night and many nights before that.  I have never been disappointed with Hana.  Usually amazed.  The chefs and staff are great at what they do.  Hana uses fresh garnishes that I haven't seen in other sushi bars in town.  Pickled wasabi is one of them.  They accent with little ingredients  that make the food and presentation so much better and interesting.The fish is out of this world.  We give chef Kojisan the option to create a dinner for us (my partner and I) and what comes out from behind that bar is natural goodness enhanced by a master's creative touch.They know us at Hana.  We get the rockstar treatment along with good suggestions and samples of something new on the menu.  We are usually blown away.We had the ramen noodles last night for the fist time.  Wow!!!  That pork was incredible.  For the first time we tried the Kobe beef sashimi.  Not bad.  Not bad.The staff at Hana are super friendly.  They are always wearing smiles in that busy atmosphere.  There are seldom new faces within the staff.  The employees stick around.  It must be a great place to work.  It is a fun environment.Hana does it right.  In all aspects.

0	5OoLuhH-ZHIre7VHGOPzbw	fdmr-zp6djodxSo5KTJqhQ	I had such a great time at this place both times i went.  The first visit was a sushi dinner extravaganza with my sister.  The place was literally a 10 minute walk from my childhood home, where my parents still live, which was the first bonus for this place.  Once i walked in my excitement grew.  The place was small and intimate although a bit on the hot side.  Our waitress spoke with a heavy japanese accent and she was very friendly.  We ordered a bunch of rolls, they have a fairly small selection of rolls which is fine with me, and some nigiri.  They even had Uni!  i dont know how it is in phoenix but i live in Salt Lake City and Uni is incredibly hard to find there for some unknown reason.  Anyways the sushi was well prepared and tasted very fresh.  Their yellowfin was just amazing!My next visit was a lunch with my mother a few days later and we ate mostly non-sushi offerings which were also very good.  I had yakisoba which was delicious and my mother had the bento box with teriyaki steak which was also fantastic.  This place is a real gem and for me personally the location is perfect.

0	-tTVsQTMRB3GwurrX67D-w	-U9LhQh4Cce6TG5bsMMP6w	Very friendly staff!, but this review only applies to the food, since we got  it to go.  Pretty boring order consisting of a california roll, a spicy tuna roll, and a squid salad ( so it should have been hard to screw up, right?).  The California roll, was just crab and cucumber....no avocado, which was really odd to me. It wasn't bad, just missing avocado. Rice is a good consistency. The spicy tuna was rancid....gross, plus I paid $8.00 for something I couldn't eat. And then the squid salad tasted off....and this is something I eat for lunch at least twice a week from this little japanese market, so I know my squid salad.  We ended up throwing everything out. It's obvious our first time will be our last.	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	2	2011-10-19	1	0
0	FzVJ7hLieHIhKgK2T3O6EQ	csGjL0MIJ05Reb33FjBo5g	Hana was my first experience with Sushi and it was good, but now that I've tried other sushi places I'm convinced this is not the best but its pretty good. Their presentation is very good, always very friendly. The only problem I would say is that its so small. If the people that sat down in the table bext to you are too loud then you might not enoy your meal so much. Its like your part of their conversation now, and of course you might be waiting for a while. They should really think about opening a bigger location.	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	3	2013-11-12	0	0

The second time I went was o.k. - the spicy tuna was average, but the volcano roll was awesome! I think the trick to Hana is sticking with their House specialties (like the volcano roll and Bento Box - and asking the waiters/waitresses what they recommend.

9	MfxdEmaH-0_ITpuXU4Hgzg	0iVIvJyTQfPCkBXII7kE8g	Recently we hit up the sushi bar with Kiltlifter in tow to indulge in some Japanese Wagyu beef. I caught a tweet about it and just could not resist. It was insanely good as you might imagine. A quick kiss over hot coals on your own personal chimney and grate, and I mean lightening fast to avoid over cooking the exquisitely marbled meat. Just a slight dip in the house made (yuzu?) flavored sauce it was very tasty indeed. Silky smooth fatty meaty five star territory goodness, yum. It became somewhat comical when other patrons got in on the fun as the joint filled with smoke from the fat hitting the hot coals. Some folks were just not meant to have this responsibility. Way too many people dead set on annihilating  this premium beef by over cooking these wafer thin morsels. They most definitely needed professional  supervision. Maybe at the very least you should be required to complete a simple questionnaire before they turn you loose on the good stuff.The heathens that we are we did somewhat of a surf and turf type dealio. We ordered several pieces of nigiri which we let the chef choose. No qualms about the fish quality, but I found some of the pieces were just too heavy handed with the crispy garlic tidbits. I love garlic, but this just overpowered some of the fish. Totally over gilded the lily, let the fish shine!So if you are not following on twitter, get on it!

1	lX1Pvn_AgD9fUffPsioeVw	OoEbaXT_5aFgEygfnNvWdQ	I've tried a lot of sushi places in Phoenix and I can confidently say that this is the best. While the menu is limited, they quality of the fish is the best that you can imagine in the desert. We ordered multiple types of nigiri and I think that overall the fish quality is good, but they need to work on their seasoning. The rice had such a faint vinegar taste, that with any strong fish, you couldn't even tell it was there. The fish slices were also not seasoned at all. I typically try a piece just as is to taste for quality and seasoning, but this was one of the first times, I really felt like I needed to add soy sauce and wasabi to all the fish slices.  In addition, we ordered the sake steamed clams, the gyudon nabe and okonomiyaki. The sake steamed clams were excellent but we had to send the first one back due to them having way to much sand in them. The gyudon nabe was amazing! very savory with a light sweetness and very hot and filling on a cold night! Okonomiyaki was okay at best. My bf is a huge fan of okonomiyaki and this was made way to thick and wasn't very seasoned as well. The service was also extremely attentive and friendly. The employees there were very helpful with suggestions (sometimes too helpful) and just very friendly to talk too. I will def be back, and I wish they were closure to where I lived because its kinda of a drive to get here. Amazing sushi, prices are a little higher but its the best in a desert so its worth it!

Our kids came with us and they were given a cute little boat with rice balls and won ton chips! So nice! My kids gobbled those up quickly :) We ordered nigiri sushi and a couple of rolls.  The portions are always so plentiful and yummy! My 7 year old loves the miso soup and my 5 year old loves plain, cold tofu which isn't on the menu but they happily brought some out to us.  I always get the iced green tea which comes in a can, its very good.  The servers are so friendly and so nice to our kids. Thank you, Hana!   We will be back!	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	5	2012-01-19	1	0

As an example it was dryer than when i wake up after sleeping with my mouth open in Phoenix.Definitly sat in awkward silence for awhile though... :\  good thing we had a gift card to this place...cause i would be upset if i had to pay that much for this place and recieved poor quality food like that...

0	h2KVxcdzCYZ0ZBCUQQaB6Q	oh1cfEg__o8G3q4rHiFBVg	1.  Got off to a bad start--tried to call but their phone only has an answer machine. No Email contact either.  Hard place to find.  Bad location and dumpy outside.  I never would have gone in unless I had not seen them on yelp.   Small--has less than 12 tables although  bar stools as well.2.  This place has more employees than customers, so finding service is no problem.   With the high  prices they charge there is enough money to  hire.  One order of sushi and one chicken balls for $20.  But you wouldn't pay any less in Snottsdale, and the food was first rate  and  you can bring your own booze, which cuts the bill down.3.  NOTE:  they don't take reservations but this place is always packed. 8:30 on a slow weeknight, and few seats available.  I will be going back, but not on a busy weekend.4.  Also--I have been around a while and can spot a gay/lesbian hangout a mile away. This is one of them--could tell by the male ear fashion and  Hillary butch haircuts. Not that I care but if you do you might not like it here.  My guess was correct for when i was leaving I saw a bunch of gay magazines in a rack.  LOL	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	4	2016-01-08	0	0
0	e_Rmm18fK11D9-2_uzd4XQ	NUXYmS3PsMe2RmOPZYgAHQ	I will always base my opinion of a sushi restaurant according to the freshness and taste of the saba mackerel sushi. Theirs is DIVINE. I mean, it was melting in my mouth. Sometimes you forget how REALLY fresh fish tastes because you live in the desert. Hana will remind you.It's pricier than some other places, but their menu is extensive and their specials are always changing. Expect about $20-30+ a person, unless you order off the lunch/dinner menu only... but why go to a sushi bar without ordering said specialty.	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	5	2013-09-19	1	1
0	z4ZeCkjusZylNPzbodeR1Q	N6lRgXgbli4Y-K1mxvn9xA	A bit of good and bad all around -- expensive in comparison, but authentic Japanese food. Huge portions. Wifey has a tiny stomach capacity so we brought much of it home.She took a very long time to decide due to the high prices, and we almost left, when she decided on the ribeye. A good choice, the steak was amazing and full of awesome flavor.Though a bento box or a few rolls would have been nice, I chose tonkatsu ramen and it was good with lots of delightful goodies in the broth.For drinks, though they don't serve alcohol you can BYOB. I asked for hot tea, and got a can of green tea soda and cup of ice.I ordered seaweed salad, and was brought a lettuce side salad followed by the one I ordered. Next an oyster shooter. It was $9 for one presented in a small dark bowl which arrived the same time as the main course, I paused a bit, being used to seeing them viewable in a clear shot glass. Nevertheless it was tasty.On to the service: Before entering the restaurant we were greeted then seated quickly. Parking was surprisingly plentiful given the small lot, we lucked out and got a place near the door. Quite attentive wait and sushibar staff, all appropriate pleasantries spoken in Japanese, respectful and honoring us.Though the room temperature was uncomfortably hot, overall nice experience.We're on a budget so could not splurge on things we really wanted to try. Would return again at a less busy time with lower prices and less heat.	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	4	2016-07-02	1	0

5	J1yNYAjojpD_KpocG-W3KQ	myu1xuDSRLTlsDfLzm_KYw	One of these days I will learn NOT to take out of town guests to places I haven't tried first.  I was pretty excited for one of my favorite people to come and visit.  Her only request?  Sushi!  While I have my list of absolute AZ favorites (Tokyo Lobby, Toyama, Sakana, Hiro, Dozo) foolishly I decided we should try somewhere new.  Having read many good things about Hana, the choice was made.Walking into the BYOB place with our Kirin Ichiban in hand, we were ready for a great evening.  Too bad that isn't what we experienced.  After being ignored for a few minutes by everyone who passed by and even the person behind the counter, I found someone to tell that there were two of us and we would like to sit at the sushi bar.  Although there were spots open, we were left standing there for quite a while.  Do you want to stand around holding a 6-pack and not even be offered a bottle opener?  Me neither.  Once we were finally seated, we weren't told about any specials, offered water or even glasses for our beer.  Deciding to make the best of it, we ordered:Yellowtail sashimi (good, the best item we had)Spicy scallop nigiri (good)Albacore sashimi (dry, not sliced through, leaving us top pick off overcooked bits and pieces)Freshwater eel nigiri (dry and crumbly rice, falling apart at the touch)Scallop dynamite ($15+ for 'krab'?  Really?)The female sushi chef was nice but our waitress was nonexistent.  Other tables and customers at the sushi bar seemed to be getting decent service (water, getting their beer/wine/whatever from the refrigerator) but we were left without water refills (once we finally got any at all) and don't even think about getting another of those BYOB beers we brought.  It even took a while to get the unused bottles back when we were trying to leave. Lackluster food and nonexistent service at a premium price.  No thanks.	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	2	2011-07-02	5	2

Make no mistake, it is the best sushi in town, and Koji-San is the best chef, but everything else about it stinks. The wait staff is surly, and nobody could care less if you were actually in the restaurant. It is a BYOB, which I kind of like, but only if I can stop by AJ's and get a nice bottle of Sake or Shochu before hand. I recommend the ahi as it is always super fresh, and the mackerel is served in an extremely unique fashion. Nothing like looking something in the eye while you eat it.

I went for the first time on 2/15/2013 for dinner with my husband based on the reviews I read here and elsewhere that this place was really great and was craving some awesome sushi. When we pulled up I was a little disappointed as it is kind of in a strip mall area that I am not familiar with. However, after eating the food, the place could be in the middle of a landfill for all I care. We had the Hana Pride roll, uni shooters, japanese mint leaves stuffed with tuna, a yellowtail roll, an order of tuna nigiri and the tuna tataki roll. We also split their ribeye steak with shrimp. I was amazed by how fresh and delicious the sushi was. Really interesting choices that were all different but each delicious in their own way. I highly recommend the Hana Pride even though it is one of the pricier menu options because it is really awesome and totally worth the money. Besides, BYOB saves you a lot. The only thing that we could have done without was the steak, not that there was anything wrong with it. The sushi was just so good that the steak was outshined. Service was also impeccable! They refrigerated our beers and sake and were great at clearing the plates on our very small table. Can't wait to go back!	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	5	2013-02-22	1	0

We eat there several times a month and every time it is first rate.It is small yet accommodating. The seafood is as fresh as it gets in The Valley of the Sun. The menu variety makes you feel like you are actually in Japan. My favorite is the green mussels. Even for the unadventurous they are a must try.We have always had friendly, welcoming service. After a long day at work it is so nice to take our own bottle of wine and have the wonderful staff take such good care of us and treat us like family.Stop overpaying for priced sushi and Japanese food that is served at a mediocre chain. Get out and enjoy this locally owned neighborhood gem!	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	5	2011-04-13	2	1

The staff is very nice and will be as accommodating as they possibly can. It is BYOB and they will keep your drinks chilled for you. However, it is not the perfect spot for an intimate dinner or first date. You will find yourself muffling your ears and trying to compete with the noise level from every table in the room. Unfortunately my party was seated next to a large table of inconsiderate, obnoxious, cackling chicks who for some reason felt the need to constantly scream WOO HOOO throughout the entire evening. Don't get me wrong I love seeing people have a great time but this was not cool at all. My ears are still ringing from all the screeching. So here is the low-down on what we had:Tempura - 2+  Bland at bestSquid Salad -  3+ Shrimp Tempura Roll - 3, Fell apart and gummySpicy Tuna - 3, so so.. Lacked the burn that I'm used toVolcano Roll - 2, Gobs of mayo.. Gag!Baked Green Muscle - 5+ very good.I just wish the Sushi was great enough for me to overlook all this petty crap but it just wasn't. Sorry.	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	3	2008-08-16	10	8

At first glance, it doesn't look like much and out of all places a sushi joint is here!  Needless to say once you walk in the place is cozy with a hip mom & pop feel.  It's definitely dark in here, but that lounge cool feel is hot right now so I can't complain.  I'm not a big sushi eater, but my friend ordered some and thought it was pretty good.  I'll have to agree since I only took one bite.  What I ordered was amazing!  Ebi Yakisoba noodles they served here was wonderful.  There was something about the sauce that they mixed.  I asked the waitress, but apparently its chef secret.  That extra sweet after taste left in my mouth is unforgettable, but I can only say it's similar to a kimchi sweetness without the spice.  Definitely one of the best yakisobas I had in a while and that's what's going to keep me coming back since I can't figure out what's in that sauce!  Darn the food gods!  Why must to toil with my palates! - Enjoy!	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	4	2013-08-26	5	5

It's really unassuming looking outside, but the inside is nicely set up and pretty relaxing atmosphere. They have a big selection, including duck, chow fun, even some Thai stuff, etc.I got the orange chicken combo and it was quite good, it was spicy and orangey and didn't taste quite the same as everyone elses' typical recipes. The egg drop soup was pretty good. I'll probably stop in here now when I go shopping.	n8KZA9G4FvGqDBWIscpz9Q	4	2013-04-25	0	0

The only issue i had was that i waited like 15 minutes to pay for my food because the lady at the register was messing with the toothpick dispenser.	n8KZA9G4FvGqDBWIscpz9Q	4	2016-06-24	0	0

The soup was good, egg roll hot and crispy and the veggies crisp and fresh in the garlic shrimp entree. The fried rice was just OK. Suggestion to the restaurant: serve the egg roll on a separate plate so it does not get soggy while touching or sitting in the sauce of the main dish.Will definitely go back.	n8KZA9G4FvGqDBWIscpz9Q	5	2017-01-20	0	0

I like how when I order a shrimp dish they give me 12-13 pieces compared to other places that will give you maybe 5 or 6 and cut in half. Really good bang for your buck. I will say though I always used to order the Roast Duck and it seems like they changed the flavor or cook and it's just not the same anymore. They used to serve it in the sauce and now the sauce comes served on the side, just doesn't taste as flavorful. But aside from that, this will always be my go-to place!	n8KZA9G4FvGqDBWIscpz9Q	5	2016-08-27	0	0

0	977jwJDtl9rc9s-pLuTllA	vg9FJ3LRFM1pEkgl67Bzmg	"""This is a serviceable, but not exciting, Americanized Chinese restaurant. Unfortunately, it is about the best you can do for Chinese food in the Avondale/Goodyear area.My wife and I ordered the orange chicken meal, the Mongolian beef meal, and a small hot and sour soup. The meals seem to be a good deal to add several extras to an entrée for only a dollar or so. Choosing the meal upgrade trades out your white rice from the standard entrée for some lo mein noodles and some fried rice. In addition, you get a single vegetable eggroll and a single fried cheese puff. These extras add volume and variety to your meal without being particularly interesting or delicious. From a food-volume-for-price perspective, it is a good deal, but you shouldn't expect any of the extras to be special. The eggroll in particular was extremely subpar, As it reminded me of an eggroll I could have bought frozen and cooked at my own home. The cheese puff was delicious, but then again it's difficult to screw up fried dough with a lump of cream cheese in the middle. The """"fried rice"""" really looks to be nothing more then some rice which was made brown by some kind of unremarkable sauce. The lo mein was similarly disappointing, there was very little to it other than noodles and some sauce, although the sauce did add a nice flavor. The hot and sour soup was one of the high points, as the broth was a deep rich brown with a little bit of thickness to it, it had a generous amounts of tofu cabbage mushrooms etc. and the hot and sour flavors were nicely balanced.My wife's orange chicken was tasty, but literally included nothing other than the chicken and the sauce. It did not even include the standard steamed broccoli to add a little bit of vegetable into the meal. There wasn't even the pretense of adding something healthy here, and the vegetables were sorely missed. The Mongolian beef was quite delicious but similarly unhealthy. It consisted of reasonably tender chunks of beef extremely large amount of sauce, and green onions along with slices of regular onion which had been stirfried with the beef. From my experience this is pretty much par for the course when it comes to Mongolian beef.My biggest complaint about the restaurant was the lack of variety on the menu. They were probably only about 10 different beef dishes, a handful of vegetable dishes, seven or eight seafood dishes, and the same number of chicken dishes. I couldn't find a single item on the menu with eggplant in it. What kind of a Chinese restaurant doesn't have eggplant and beef on the menu? There were a handful of Chinese/Thai offerings, but as someone who greatly enjoys Thai food, I would never risk ordering even a simple curry from a restaurant like this.So long as you're expecting cheap Americanized Chinese food, you will get what you pay for. I can see us returning to this restaurant for that purpose at some point, but not often. Make sure what you like to order is on the menu before going, because even certain standard offerings maybe missing."""	n8KZA9G4FvGqDBWIscpz9Q	3	2015-12-05	0	0

This made for a slightly uncomfortable setting.  Besides the temperature, I loved the place.  Seemed like a mom and pop shop which I always like.  So lets change it up and  talk food.  Wow....  It was tasty!  Got the Papa a La Huancaina for an appetizer and it was amazing.  I was disappointed at first because it looked so plain, just boiled potatoes cut in half smothered in a sauce.  However, after that first bite I was hooked.  These were amazing.  Got a couple of their drinks, and they were pretty tasty as well, however I wouldn't get those again.  My wife got Tallarines Verdes and it was amazing.  The pasta was a great pesto green color, which had initially concerned me it would have too strong of a pesto flavor.  It did not.  The pasta was actually nice and creamy with a perfect amount of flavor.  I got the Ceviche Mixto.  This was outstanding.  The assortment of seafood was great, the presentation was pretty, and the sauce was amazing.  Packed full of a nice lime-kick with some spice.  The waiter talked me out of going 'spicy' and went for 'medium' instead, which was probably a good idea.  Medium had a nice amount of spice that built up, but was never too spicy to ruin or mask flavors.  I would love to go back and try some other options the food was very good.	lCd20nDS9rFHW_2KViqWUA	4	2014-06-08	0	0

As adventurous as my palate is, I had never been to this local gem. LOVED IT! LOVED IT! LOVED IT! The ambiance, the people, the fact that a mother and father along with their two sons run this place was a huge plus for me. Along with their Momma, the sons are the chefs creating some of their own along with recipes handed down by their ancestors. The flavors are incredible. I can't wait to take the family back. Another fabulous local go to place for me... Woohoo!!!!	lCd20nDS9rFHW_2KViqWUA	5	2015-12-24	1	1

We were charged $7 extra  to replace the chicken with meet for the arroz chaufa. I have never spent $20 on just arroz chaufa. Lomo saltado was little salty and around $17  we are visiting from Los Angeles and maybe we are just spoiled but there's a big difference. FYI the explanation for the extra charge was that they use sirloin!!! Well in Los Angeles they use Fillet Mignon!Also if you get a chance to sit at the bar facing the kitchen you might be disappointed that most of there food is microwaved.	lCd20nDS9rFHW_2KViqWUA	2	2017-03-05	2	0

The ceviche was awesome!  Pisco sour was tasty but a tad overpriced at $9. Suggest grabbed a few pints of craft brew at the Main Ingredient Ale House down the street beforehand if you are looking for some craft beer.	lCd20nDS9rFHW_2KViqWUA	5	2016-06-17	0	0

Our favorite is the arroz con pollo with cilantro rice, aji potatoes, and pickled onions. The chicken is so flavorful, moist. The rice has pieces of the giant corn in it.We've also tried the ceviche, escabeche de pollo, carapulcra. All great.Love how they serve cancha, the Peruvian corn nuts, as a pre-meal snack!	lCd20nDS9rFHW_2KViqWUA	5	2015-05-05	0	0
0	xQEOcgW2aO08GXwH09KrVA	bH9V9mHTWjzEPurTCprI4g	The reason I rated it ok was due to the service.  The food was excellent.  It is a small restaurant and we went on a Friday evening (myself and another person) We were told we would have to sit at the bar because the tables for 4 people were being held for people of 3 or more. the bar is right at the front door so I didn't feel comfortable sitting there. I spotted an empty table for two near the window and asked if we could sit there. We would told yes (why she didn't ask us if we wanted that table in the beginning, I don't know). We were given menus and ordered our food with just water for beverage. It does take a while for the food to come but the portions are good and the food was delicious. I had the ESCABECHE DE POLLO (chicken garnished with sautéed red onion, aji amarillo, aji panca, & vinegar), my partner had the ARROZ CON POLLO (Cilantro based green rice with veggies, & chicken). The waitress never came back to refill our water or check on us. Customer service is big with me and even though the food was excellent, I'd have to rethink going back.	lCd20nDS9rFHW_2KViqWUA	3	2015-12-04	0	0

My only complaints: very little parking and no Peruvian beer to wash down the food.  Did I mention that actual Peruvians eat here?  That has got to count for something.	lCd20nDS9rFHW_2KViqWUA	4	2015-04-07	0	0
0	wlc3ueOUwo5e3NFqeVWeDw	ExOvB7_2F3mvlo-VFTat7Q	This week the Jolly Diner went to a Peruvian restaurant called El Chullo on 7th Street in Phoenix. I can't pronounce the names of each of the entrees, but I have to say that they were very well prepared and presented. All of the food we had was just excellent. They weren't too spicy and artfully presented. They also serve Peruvian drinks. The waitress was very kind and able to explain each of the dishes, and each was delicious. Joining us this week were my daughter and her husband who is Chilean/Peruvian - so we had a subject matter expert. The Jolly Diners rated El Chullo a 3.5 out of 5. The decor is nice, parking is a bit challenging, but worth it because the food tastes great and is reasonably priced.If you like to try something different and authentically Peruvian, you'll have to try El Chullo.	lCd20nDS9rFHW_2KViqWUA	4	2016-10-01	0	0

0	d_TBs6J3twMy9GChqUEXkg	syvgxGvlJV4fqm7_3xKXuA	I had the pleasure to go to El Chullo this morning for 'breakfast' (the quotes are because it was closer to lunch time and their breakfast foods are more like American lunch/dinner foods). This place is incredibly authentic. Our waiter (and possibly an owner?) is from a town just outside of Lima, so ya... pretty legit. The way their breakfast works is they have 3 choices that feed two people, each for 20$. The choices are chicharrones with a tamal, bread, and two coffees or a tenderloin sautee with bread and two coffees, or an egg dish with a tamal, bread and two coffees. We decided to get the tenderloin and add a tamal (cuz I wanted to try it). The tamal is large, delicious, and just like the ones I had when I was in Peru last summer... this is the real deal and very distinct from the typical Mexican tamale you may have elsewhere in Phoenix. The tamal has a little hard boiled egg (which obviously I ate and the husband didn't), some meat, some olives, and some hot peppers and served with an onion/citrus salad.... so good. I could just eat those tamals and be happy.  The tenderloin came in a sauce of sorts with onion and tomato and we ate it with the giant rolls given to us. The meat was soooo tender and flavorful. Their coffee was even good and we drank it black. The service is great. This place beats all of the other Peruvian restaurants that I have tried in town hands down and really took me back to when I was in Peru....like a little slice of vacation in my own neighborhood. I will certainly be back, I want to try dinner for sure and the chicharrones breakfast.... I think this place has serious 5 star potential, so we will see!	lCd20nDS9rFHW_2KViqWUA	4	2014-03-16	3	2

0	9o7FH8_h247yLClH_EnPog	qi4gtT75n0UQ2uPLnT-x3w	Hello, I have  been going to this restaurant for probably five years now. I have come to rate Peruvian cuisine, the best in the world, in my opinion. As far as that last review by a lady named Leslie, I think she was way too hard on them. Some of the very very very best restaurants are just small little places, and family owned.! Sometimes you have to have patience when places like that are busy. They always always are welcoming, so she must of had an attitude problem. And that's probably hitting the nail on the head! I love this place and so do many of my friends. Don't let it get you down, El. chullo! We still luv you!  It's the best Peruvian food in the whole valley! And I've been to the other ones. I could tell you way way way worse stories.	lCd20nDS9rFHW_2KViqWUA	5	2017-06-05	0	0

I feel like I should always try these tiny places with """"foreign"""" food but I never really do because I'm afraid most would be misses rather than hits. This was a hit and has inspired to try more places like this!

The Anticucho and Yuca Fritas were so good I will definitely order them every time I go!Then each of us order an entree. I got the Arroz con Mariscos, Jess got the Arroz con Pollo, my fiance the Ceviche and Josh the Lomo Saltado. To be honest I was pretty disappointed with my dish because it was more like a plate of rice with 4 pieces of seafood. However, Jess' Pollo tasted amazing, it had great seasoning. Mike's cveiche and Josh's Lomo were great too. We all left stuffed and happy!We will definitely be going back. Love the vibe of a family restaurant.

1	fr0Nen1J499HvNml3_6OYA	pVyY6tPJbcMgPcAjN-PD3g	First tip-Parking lot in the back through an alley. Easier than the front. My friend and I came here to check it out and overall, we loved it. We came on a Saturday for lunch and it wasn't crowded so we got one on one personal treatment with the chef so we learned a lot. Not to sound like a broken record but the ceviche is soooo good. I love the flavors. The ceviche is just the fish marinated and the ceviche mixto is fish, squid, mussels, and clams.  I think the ceviche of just fish is the better of the two. It just holds the flavor better.  And when they ask you how spicy, they actually mean it. The medium is pretty decently spicy.  So impressive since it's hard to actually get something to be spicy here in Phoenix.  I can only imagine how spicy hot is.  Been here three times and I still crave it. Ok, on to other things I've tried several things and so far only one thing wasn't all that great but everything else has been.The causa rellena with imitation crab would be the one thing i say to avoid. My friend and I didnt think it was all that great esp. The arroz con pollo was yummy. The carapulcra is a pork stew and is like a comfort food. If you like spicy, make sure to ask for the aji rocoto - Peruvian hot sauce/salsa. So yummy. It adds a good spice to the mild dishes. Good lomo saltado according to bf. I do like that the fries are crispy and skinny. The kicker is that if you go now, they finally have air conditioning!!!  It was getting to be a bit difficult going during the summer so I can only imagine how the workers felt. Warning though, if you are from California and used to Peruvian food there, they don't carry the green aji sauce that we know and love.  Apparently that's only a CA creation since we're so used to jalapeños.This is a must place. From the wait staff to the food, everything is too notch.	lCd20nDS9rFHW_2KViqWUA	5	2014-08-23	4	1

This is not fine dining, it is a neighborhood place with as close to homemade latin food as you can get. I started with some yucca frittas which were great and came with two very tasty salsas. I had a chicken dish (forgot the name) with a red sauce that was slightly greasy but packed with flavor and delicious. My friend had the arroz con pollo which was also excellent. Crap even the iced tea was apparently homemade. The server was attentive and made us feel at home. The place doesn't look like much but it is a great place for well prepared Peruvian food at good prices. I will definitely go here again when I'm in town.	lCd20nDS9rFHW_2KViqWUA	4	2016-03-10	0	0

Don't let the interior (or exterior) discourage you.  Having absolutely no experience with Peruvian cuisine I had not idea what the carapulcra would be.

Truly a hole-in-the-wall from the outside but a nice cozy restaurant in the inside. The wait staff were friendly and efficient. I had the Yuca Fritas appetizer and Mariscos con Arroz entreé. I enjoy the Yuca and the two sauces. Some of the Yuca pieces were hard and stringy, but the rest was quite nice. The Mariscos were a disappointment. A few pieces of the seafood were very hard and chewy like they were seriously overlooked. These pieces were inedible. Most of the rest of the dish was good, but not great. I was expecting more flavor that would make this uniquely Peruvian. I will come back again and order a completely different entreé. I want to like this place and I think it's definitely worth another shot.	lCd20nDS9rFHW_2KViqWUA	3	2015-09-10	0	0

I have never had peruvian food before so I can't really compare my experience to another peruvian restaurant. The lot is small and it's kind of hard to park.  The service is good.  The server was really friendly and he tried to give us recommendations.  I ordered the Lomo Saltado and it was flavorful, but I didn't see the difference between that and the nacho fries that you get at Filibertos for half the price. Now, don't get me wrong.  It was a cool experience, but when we got the bill, it was a little much for an appetizer sampler, a drink, one entree, and dessert. I didn't even end up with a doggie bag for the price we paid. I didn't expect to pay as much as what we had paid, but I know they have to pay their bills.  It's a  business.  I get it. I just don't know if I would justify the price and value of the food to come back.  If you have never had peruvian food, come on over though and try it. At least once.	lCd20nDS9rFHW_2KViqWUA	3	2014-04-08	1	0

I just wish it was closer to my house but it's better than nothing!	lCd20nDS9rFHW_2KViqWUA	5	2016-06-29	0	0

You can thank me later!!!Came here to have lunch with family. I had been craving lomo saltado, if you never had this dish order it! Their lomo saltado is very tasty and definitely will come for more. I also had pisco which is Peruvian brandy and trust me that stuff will sneak up on you, I had the mango pisco sour please try it!And you guys know I am a sucker for dessert  I ordered Alfajores, basically a cookie sandwich but don't be fooled this cookie sandwich comes straight from the cookie gods lol. I also ordered Lucuma ice cream which is a tropical fruit that honestly tastes better than pumpkin spice anything. Customer service is amazing! Very friendly and funny staff highly recommend this	lCd20nDS9rFHW_2KViqWUA	5	2016-10-11	2	2

We were sat at a tiny little table in the middle of the restaurant that was smokey. We waited 10 minutes and never even offered glass of water!	lCd20nDS9rFHW_2KViqWUA	1	2015-07-29	0	0

Such was the case during my first visit to El Chullo. Admittedly I'm a novice when it comes to Peruvian cuisine so it was with some apprehension that I ventured here on a Saturday around Noon.  I had seen the great reviews this place was getting, but honestly had no idea what to order when I got there.  Fortunately my waitress helped guide me through it, and helped me make some delicious choices indeed.As with so many Mom & Pop ethnic establishments in the Downtown Phoenix vicinity, the restaurant is a small space in an old building.  This space is on the northeast corner of 7th Street & Virginia, in between a barber shop and a convenience store.  There's barely any parking up front (though there were available spots when I arrived).  There is, fortunately, extra parking available in back (take the alleyway east of the convenience store and you'll run into a parking lot leading into El Chullo's back entrance).  The restaurant itself seats about 20-25 including the bar area.  When you walk in you immediately hear the Peruvian dance music in the background.  When I arrived just before Noon I was actually the only customer there, though the lunch crowd started streaming in shortly thereafter.  A quick FYI that from 10am-Noon on the weekends, they serve breakfast only.  It was close enough to Noon that they allowed me to go with the lunch menu instead, but just be aware of this if you're coming here on the weekend.  I started things off by ordering a traditional Pisco Sour.  Pisco is basically a type of Peruvian Brandy and a Sour is traditionally mixed with lime, syrup, bitters, and egg whites.  Wow, talk about refreshing.  There's enough alcohol to remind you its a cocktail, but truly a smooth, delicious, easy drinking cocktail perfect for any occasion.  For an appetizer I went with the Causa Rellena with crab filling (you can also choose a chicken filling).  Two potato cakes with crab filling and avocado in the middle, topped with a dusting of cilantro, half a hard boiled egg, and what I believe was a liquified sweet potato sauce.  Holy moly was this awesome.  It wasn't huge (maybe 3 inches in diameter & 3 inches tall), but remarkably rich and filling.  I'm not sure what type of potato they used for the potato cakes, but the texture was smoother than any potato I've had (maybe they used extra butter?).  And there was plenty of crab meat in there to be sure.  If you're coming here for the first time, get this.  I'm making it mandatory.After the appetizer, I had no idea what I was doing, so I let the waitress pick the next two items for me.  For the main entree, she recommended trying one of the ceviches since this was my first time here.  I went with the Ceviche Mixto since that had a variety of seafood (though admittedly I didn't ask which kinds).  The seafood is garnished with onions and a spicy lime juice blend (you can get it super spicy, or go with a mild spice level as I did) and comes with sides of sweet potatoes, sweet corn, and cancha (basically dried corn).  Again, didn't look like a huge portion but they packed in a ton of seafood into this dish. In addition to the fish (which I believe was sea bass) there was lots of shrimp, clams, mussels, calamari, and octopus.  I'm not a huge fan of squid or octopus so I was a little apprehensive when I saw it, but actually this style tasted quite delicious.  All of the seafood tasted fresh and the lime sauce had the perfect amount of seasoning.  There's actually enough food in this dish to be split by two people, which probably explains why I felt pretty full after I finished.  Nevertheless, the waitress prodded me to try one of their desserts, so she had me try the Alfajor.  Two round flaky sugar cookies covered in powdered sugar with dulce de leche filling in the middle and chocolate sauce on the side.  I don't how in the world I had room for this, but I made it happen.  The dulce de leche was buttery smooth and the cookie cut with a fork.  An awesome, decadent conclusion. Absolutely incredible meal.  The presentation, the flavors, and the variety was amazing.  They actually have a number of chicken and beef dishes to choose from as well, and I'll be sure to try those upon my next visit.  Total cost for this go around including the drink, appetizer, entree, dessert, tax and tip came to $50.  Worth every penny as El Chullo's cuisine could easily work as a fine dining experience (though I'm thrilled its just a neighborhood joint that I can wear my flip flops to).  I now see why Peruvian cuisine is quickly conquering American pallets, and El Chullo is Phoenix's ground zero.	lCd20nDS9rFHW_2KViqWUA	5	2015-04-25	3	0
1	icMCEESVs2TU_NkIZM142w	VxeUVhFCSXUAEL-1PUKR5A	"""We decided to live up to our hype of being open-minded and try something unique to Phoenix (i.e., not Mexican; not Vietnamese; not Chinese; etc.).  And that's how we ended up at El Chullo; though, to be fair, we almost DIDN'T end up at El Chullo's.  A previous reviewers comment about parking being limited is like saying Marlon Brando was slightly overweight towards the end.  Let's just say, the parking lot is shared with other businesses; the """"lot"""" is about one car wide; and one has to do fancy gyrations to park and withdraw one's car IF one can get a spot.  After driving around three times, we parked in the printing shop's lot across the street (which, I'm sure, will thrill them to no end when/if they read this).  Go during the standard 9 to 5 business hours and you may find yourself outta luck or risking a tow.Alas, the parking spots are not the only thing small about El Chullo.  In fact, """"small"""" pretty much describes it all:  the parking. the restaurant, the portions.  I was rather amused (bemused) by the comment from one of the reviewers that the portions are """"very large"""".  Really?  VERY large?  Perhaps for someone who survived  internment at Sherrif Joe's Tent City or who usually dines on those diet programs' pre-packaged food (served in upscale concentration camps).  Granted, this is not to say that the portions were pretentiously small like a la carte francais food; they were perfectly acceptably sized for people, who eat like they're supposed to  (translation:  non-Americans).  We, however, are of the MOO crowd, so for us, all of dinner was something akin to """"snack"""".  (Hey, I workout, get off my case!).We started out with the appetizer platter for $14.95 and chose the Chicken Causa Rell; the Papa Rellena; and the Papa ala Huancaina.  Presented very artistically, I would not say it was an appetizer for two AMERICANS.  Taste was quite good and unique, though the standout taste was potato (hardly a surprise since """"papa"""" means 'potato').I had a very spicy cerviche mixto and my other half, the escabeche de pollo.  Both very good -- the latter served with rice and a small portion of cold, sweet potato -- but we weren't exactly unbuckling our belts at meal's end.  Again, like I said:  not small, but not big by the usual, middle-class American standards, where the men are men, eat like men, and doctors buy brand new cars every month with all the money they get from bypass and pacemaker surgeries.  Nuff said.The diet Inka Cola, colored like Mountain Dew but tasting like cream soda, is good, but $2.00 a can?  For both of us, the bill came to $46.41 without tip.  Not tragic, but a bit overboard for the quantity.  Maybe reasonable considering the uniqueness of the food.  The 20% tip for Omar, however, was well in line.  Attentive service without being overbearing and very accommodating.  That's one thing I really can't make any complaints about (and as you see, I have no issue complaining).While I agree with the other, previous 17 reviewers that this is a very nice restaurant, I am not wowed enough to give it 5 Stars.  Those who read my reviews know I'm not generous with my highest rating and you've got to earn it.  For those looking for something different, tasty and served with good attitude, this restaurant is just fine.  If you're a big eater, don't expect to come here and not want something more afterwards.  No one there looked unhappy and we weren't either ... just not full."""	lCd20nDS9rFHW_2KViqWUA	3	2014-03-22	1	0

I had not seen this preparation before and as a Peruvian and a foodie I have an abundant amount of experience in Peruvian cuisine! The flavor was incredible, bursting with flavor! A bit of Rocoto to add a nice touch of spiciness. I had to order a side a rice so I could absorb all of the fabulous juice. My wife had a sampler platter with Papa a la Huancaina, papa rellena and causa! She raved about each of them. She also had an Afajor for dessert and it was wonderful! The owners are a family, each contributing to the success of the restaurant! Pricing is competitive. We went this evening  and had to wait about 15 minutes as we apparently are not the only ones who know about this wonderful little restaurant! The restaurant is small but as they continue to build a clientele, this place is certain to grow and be even more successful!	lCd20nDS9rFHW_2KViqWUA	5	2016-07-31	0	0

I've been several times, and the food is always delicious. My favorite is the Tacu Tacu with lomo. I get it every time, but I know I should try other things too! The ceviche and lomo soltado are also very good. The ceviche is fresh, and the lomo just doesn't disappoint - full of flavor! This time around, I fortunately had a friend who was wanting to split two dishes! I forget the one she got (it's in the pictures), but it was a beef stew. The beef was very tender, but we both agreed the Tacu Tacu was better of the two. The Tacu Tacu has a great consistency and texture. It's crispy on the outside and firm, not mushy, on the inside. The lomo that comes with it is in a sauce with onions and tomatoes - very flavorful! The ooooooonly thing that I'll say bad about this place that it may be a tad too salty sometimes.  Overall, I'm a big fan....and I need more people who are willing to split dishes with me!! :)"""	lCd20nDS9rFHW_2KViqWUA	5	2016-12-31	3	1

The chicken is described as pan fried but it didn't taste fried, and I mean that in a good way, and the sauce was very tasty.

The adults had a carafe of white sangria and the kids had a Peruvian staple, chicha.We had the appetizer platter, and chose fried yuca, causa rellena, and a Peruvian tamal. We ate every last ounce of food and sauce!For our entrees, the kids had the tallarin and salchipapas, and the adults had ceviche and the mixed seafood platter. The ceviche was some of the best Peruvian ceviche we've had. The seafood platter was made up of deep fried fish, shrimp, calamari, and oysters. It was served with boiled potatoes and fried yuca.Everything was great, and the service was awesome. The seafood platter was a little over cooked, but then again it's deep fried so what can you expect. We will definitely come back and bring our Peruvian neighbors to enjoy tasty authentic food they don't have to prepare themselves. :-)	lCd20nDS9rFHW_2KViqWUA	4	2016-01-10	3	1

0	gOVcfXAj254BdxmcRXPLMQ	CTAnxNK7W7DtkX1K-VNf3w	Peruvian cuisine seems to be based on chicken and potatoes- fine with me. El Chullo is a New Times Award winning place on 7th Street north of Virginia. Can't remember the names of what I ordered but the appetizer was a thin sliced marinated fried potato. You eat them like potato chips but they are not dry and slightly crispy. The entrée was a chicken breast, pan fried in a red pepper vinegar sauce with red onion slices. Very good! There was a small side of potatoes and a rather large pyramid of white rice. I love rice but I prefer it flavored. I almost asked for more red pepper vinegar sauce for the rice. It was similar to Japanese sticky rice. The place was small, clean, nice artwork on the walls, flat screen tv with Fox Spanish channel showing a soccer game. They have a full bar so we ordered a carafe of Sangria- iced, filled with what appeared to be fruit cocktail- very good and pared well with the meal. We ate the wine soaked fruit like a dessert. El Chullo has an air of authenticity about it and I most likely will go back in the future.	lCd20nDS9rFHW_2KViqWUA	4	2015-05-22	1	0

It's not a big place, but once it filled up, the one waitress was running. Also, parking is limited, which is typical for DT Phoenix. Highly recommend trying at least once. Our favorites were: Lomo saltado (beef with French fries and gravy-like sauce), papa rellena (stuffed potato), tallarin saltado con carne (tenderloin with spaghetti) and of course pisco sours!	lCd20nDS9rFHW_2KViqWUA	5	2017-05-10	0	0

Neither my mom nor I had ever tried Peruvian food so we thought we would give this place a try. It's right on 7th street so parking in front of the small restaurant (7 tables and a few chairs at a small bar) is very limited, so if you miss it, just turn right on the first street and then take a right into the alley and park in the small lot behind the restaurant. You can also enter through doors on the back or walk around to the front.  We shared an appetizer and each got a meal and drink waters and our total bill was approximately $36.  We loved everything.

The menu is loaded with a good variety of Peruvian favorites. It was tough to choose what we wanted and took advantage of the photos on Yelp to decide. The server was also most helpful and gave us a good idea on how it would taste.We started with an appetizer plate that had a mixture of three different items. See my photo. The Papa Rellena was our favorite in the grouping. It is described as a golden-fried creamy potato dough stuffed with meat, eggs, raisins and olives and served with red onions marinated in lime juice. So good!The ladies ordered a dish with Rice & Peruvian beans topped with a cilantro Beef stew called Frijoles con seco a la norteña. Yours truly ordered one called Escabeche de Pollo with a side of their spicy homemade Hot Sauce. It is pan fried Chicken garnished with sautéed red onion, aji amarillo, aji panca, & vinegar.Both the food and service were spectacular.

2	Hy_ko_2hkLTxvO7G0pIGsw	LpKiGHvYCr6l5_VKzFBWxA	I love this place, my favorite cuisine first of all is peruvian, and I am so happy to say that El Chullo has become my favorite peruvian restaurant (thus far in my culinary journey). The ceviche here is perfectly spiced, the texture of the fish is great, and the sweet potatoes and the canchas (salted corn nuts) offset the spiciness, wow just typing this review makes my mouth water. I literally cannot wait to go back for more! The entree size of the ceviche isn't enough if you are starved, but its a perfect portion for someone who isn't too hungry. My boyfriend and I ordered one ceviche each and then we also ordered a lomo saltado to share. The lomo El Chulo serves is great, delicious thin fries, with nicely seasoned juicy pieces of steak topped off with onions, red onions and tomatoes. Order this if you are a steak and potatoes type of person. For dessert we shared an alfajor, 2 fine light cookies with dulce de leche stuffed between the two, finished off with a slight dusting of powdered sugar and chocolate on the side. To be perfectly honest I was so full already from eating a ceviche and sharing a lomo saltado that I felt that I didn't have any room for dessert, but when the cookie came I HAD to have a taste, so I ate a bite and we ended up packing that bad boy up to go. All in all this place was great, people might think its expensive, but its 100% worth it to me. The flavours I get from peruvian cuisine is so unique and unmatched that I am more than happy to pay for it. Oh and did I mention our server Manny, *unsure if this is the right spelling* but man he was the best!!! He made us feel right at home, and even told us a little bit of himself and Peru as we were eating our dinner.  All in all it was a great time and a great meal!

The dishes we order each went up $2-$3 each so now rather than be an excellent pricy lunch it is very expensive (e.g. Tacu tacu dish with steak is now $19.95) - wow that's too much!.Unfortunately, I won't be back soon but that's only due to the recent price increases.	lCd20nDS9rFHW_2KViqWUA	3	2017-01-17	1	0

They were able to flex and cater to my girlfriend's dietary restrictions, and the food still came out very delicious and perfectly seasoned. Would definitely recommend for a breakfast date.	lCd20nDS9rFHW_2KViqWUA	5	2015-10-11	0	0

Potatas con queso was amazing as well.  Plantains were perfectly ripe and had a delicious crisp. Ceviche was also delicious.We also took the famous dessert to go which we have not yet tried but looks fantastic.  This is definitely our new spot	lCd20nDS9rFHW_2KViqWUA	5	2017-06-16	0	1
0	nZzfFwxalMntqhWedY7sWA	eqGpX7WjwSusW__IA7RuCg	"""I was in PHX for the day and really wanted some Peruvian food since there aren't many options in Tucson for it. This place had great reviews and a friend of mine also suggested it so I had to try it out. We called ahead of time to get a reservation and they said they could """"likely squeeze us in"""" which was strange since there were not many people there when we arrived. We didn't get a very friendly vibe from the service in general.Our table got the fish ceviche, chicken tacu tacu and the seafood tacu tacu to share. The food was really great but it was all really salty! I generally like my food to be salty but it was even too much for me. In the future I would make sure to ask for less salt on the meals. Otherwise it was really flavorful."""	lCd20nDS9rFHW_2KViqWUA	3	2017-02-21	1	0

0	dcaca4CuR9-BWdUayNR5tA	muTM7ofau9ZS_UO8Uio1Eg	The next best thing to actually being in Peru. The beverages were great - the Pisco Sour and Chicha Morada deserve 5 stars by themselves. The entrees were also a hit. I ordered the Aji de Gallina, and my boyfriend ordered the Ceviche. He was so blown away by the Ceviche that he wants to go back for it every weekend. The only thing I wasn't a huge fan of was the appetizer. We ordered Yuca Frita, and it was a little over-fried for my taste. Overall, it was a great dining experience. I am from Peru and felt like I was eating from my family's kitchen. I will mention that it ended up being a bit pricey, BUT it was worth it.	lCd20nDS9rFHW_2KViqWUA	5	2017-02-22	0	0
1	YfvMjY-G6y86Ov2tS5Txww	WhDf9QyCsSjiUsvN2A_zrQ	Peruvian cuisine is Interesting,  flavorful and varied. El Chullo is a very small restaurant so recommend making reservations. Thee stars only as I thought the staff was not the friendliest and the Sangria was mostly fruit juice and very little wine. The parking lot in front of restaurant is very small with very few spots so be ready to park in the neighborhood. Ordered the Lomo Saltado, which essentially is slivers of beef with French fries. and while I thought was good, could have had more meat considering the price of $ 14.95 . El Chullo is not an inexpensive restaurant. A word of caution, the restaurant closes early on Sundays at 7 P.M so get there early.	lCd20nDS9rFHW_2KViqWUA	3	2015-08-28	1	1

Love their food, as close as you can get to authentic Peruvian here in Phoenix. It's a tiny hole in the wall but so worth it! Aren't those always the best places tho? This is a for sure must! Lomo saltado and jalea mixta are great! Also the antichchos!	lCd20nDS9rFHW_2KViqWUA	5	2016-10-12	0	0

0	wBlKRc7sbcH2Z78RJWvOjw	KaEQchTrjxeytnJSEFBGYA	Positive:Great service, friendly, genuine people. Family-owned and it shows.Appetizers are awesome. Best I've had in a Peruvian restaurant in Arizona. The anticuchos are just right and ideally spiced, the ocopa was perfect, the papa rellena was delicious.The spices and general flavor is authentic, rich and tasty.There is a good variety of dishes, some of which you can't find elsewhere in Arizona.Presentation is good, sides are well chosen. Portions are bigger than average for the entrees.Lucuma ice cream tasted just like in Peru.Not so good:-Dishes are somewhat overpriced.  -The arroz con mariscos could use more seafood, more limon and more aji. It was too greasy and not spicy enough.-Although the food was clean, and so were the napkins and silverware, there were a few bugs crawling on the floor. It's understandable. The weather is heating up. I just never saw that many in a restaurant. Some pest control would be a good idea.Overall, I recommend this place for authentic Peruvian food and family ambience. It's cozy and fun. You just have to be choosy about what to order so it's worth the money and tastes good!	lCd20nDS9rFHW_2KViqWUA	4	2014-04-13	1	1

Now that would be authentic! In any case, my foodie friends and I ordered individually but different dishes. I went with the Tallarin Saltado, a spaghetti like dish with beef. Overall, it was pretty solid. Salty and just a tad bit of spice, with the crunch of the raw onions giving this dish a savory bite!However, my 2 favorites of the night were the beef heart and the fried rice! Beef heart anyone!? Yeah, it came a super spicy sauce you can add and when I say be careful.....BE CAREFUL! Youch! Spicy indeed, but the heart was so tender....uh yummy! The fried rice...I thought my mama made good fried rice; sorry mom! Overall, one of the best bite of fried rice I had in a while. It was a blend of Peruvian and Chinese style so I totally appreciate the fusion and so will you!The service was spot on with our large group plus no mix up with our checks, which is totally awesome. The place is very tiny so be sure to make your reservations! - Enjoy!	lCd20nDS9rFHW_2KViqWUA	5	2014-06-30	8	4

0	vWtX3HVddxxAjFw_jZHZBA	Ec3nV4KsW9WCplfaUxYTjQ	My new favorite Peruvian restaurant. I had the tallarines verdes with the bistek on the side (for my carnivorous husband) because I don't eat meat and they were more than accommodating and did not seem to judge me for doing that (which most places do). The tallarines verdes is the best I've had in Arizona and I will only go to El Chullo to have it. You know how you grab on to your bed sheets because the feeling is so glorious and out of this world? Yes, it's like that! I can't wait to try the other entrees, specifically, the vegetarian options. The alfajores is also delicious; flaky but held it's form and not overwhelmingly sweet - it definitely quieted my sweet tooth. The chicha morada is also quenching - not bitter and too sweet, just right - be sure to order the pitcher because you will drink it like water.It's a quaint place to eat. They have lunch specials/combo. The parking situation is a little challenging, but I would like to go there at least once a week to satisfy my Peruvian food cravings. I hope you check out this place because although it's easy to miss (because of location), you'll be sorry if you don't go.	lCd20nDS9rFHW_2KViqWUA	5	2014-01-10	1	1
0	jSs2q7mM_L9ZdBxgJ_gV7g	V5Y5iMEo-_u1YMP3B85FYA	My friend and I came there last night and the small restaurant was packed. Who I believe was one of the owners/main chef greeted us and explained it might be a while before we could order because they were so busy. She was so warm and kind and so was everyone else. My friend and I had a pisco maracuya (passion fruit pisco) and they were delicious. We also split a causa rellena, a cold mashed potato cake with a chicken filling, and the lomo saltado, a dish with beef tenderloin and french fries and rice.  Everything was really delicious and seasoned so well but next time I will probably opt for less starch in one meal.  I rated this five stars because I really couldn't get over how wonderful the overall experience was to talk with the Peruvian chef and feel somewhat like I was with family :). Also, this woman recommended the ceviche because it's prepared unique to Peruvian culture and I will say it looked amazing at someone else's table.	lCd20nDS9rFHW_2KViqWUA	5	2015-05-31	0	0

0	CqUtPI_RjqmOHqpxe3kETA	bGuN6pbDY0q6iCSbbh95Ig	Pros:  Food, service, price.Cons: Smaller sized restaurant (may be occasional waits), parking (park across the street - see parking section below).The food here is amazing.  I had the Tacu Tacu Con Lomo Saltado, which is rice and beans topped with strips of marinated sirloin steak.  The rice must be cooked in a small cast iron skillet and flipped over, because it has a seriously delicious exterior with a slight crunch.  The beans and lomo saltado are equally excellent.  Portion sizes are large, and they have a small selection of wine.  Really delicious and highly recommend.  Parking: After business hours (ie: 6:00pm) you can park either across 7th street at the auto shop, or across Virginia street, just south of El Chullo, in the parking lot behind the 3 story building (Techniprint).	lCd20nDS9rFHW_2KViqWUA	5	2014-08-04	5	0

1	V-BbqKqO8anwplGRx9Q5aQ	E03TXTw9lzBz01XLqiBYcg	This is a very small Peruvian Restaurant with a bar. They serve mostly Peruvian Food thats heavy with rice and lots of potatoes. They start everyone of with tasty complimentary corn nuts. We started with the Peruvian Specialty Appetizer called papas a la huancaina that means basically a boiled potato topped with a creamy chile cheese sauce. I thought it tasted good but for me this dish is an acquired taste kind of dish because of the texture. I ordered the Arroz Chaufa (a chicken fried rice) because it sounded like the lightest dish on the menu. The chicken in my dish was developed with flavor and was very moist. I thought this dish was tasty but it was an extremely large portion so I took half home.My husband had the Frijol con Seco a la Nortena (basically a beef stew with rice and beans). I tried a little piece of beef that also was prepared well and was flavorful and moist. The pickled onions were bright and bursting with lime flavor. This was also a large portion.The pictures of the desserts looked interesting and mostly different from other desserts I've seen and our server talked me into getting his favorite dessert the crema volteada. It was like a very dense flan with a dark sugar coating. It seemed rich and wasn't too sweet.Service was very friendly and welcoming.	lCd20nDS9rFHW_2KViqWUA	4	2015-05-24	2	2

My table had the Chupe de Camarones, which was a meal unto itself, 2 people had the the Aji de Gallina- which was very tasty and quite spicy and one had the Tallarines Verdes con Lomo.  We had traditional Pisco sours which were quite tasty as well.  The restaurant is very small but clean and the wait staff is vey pleasant.  The service is slow due to all plates being made to order but that is certainly one of the reasons the food is delicious.  I would definitely recommend this place if you are a fan of Peruvian food or curious to learn about it.  The prices are resonable as well. Our tab for 4 came to $153 and that was with 8 Pisco sours.

I had chicharrones, a stuffed potato pastry that was cooked perfectly and full of flavor. Both were served with lime juice and cilantro marinated red onions that gave the dishes such perfect balance. A pork stew for my entree and I was stuffed to the gills and exceedingly pleased. The staff is crazy friendly. Will go back four to five million more times.	lCd20nDS9rFHW_2KViqWUA	5	2016-04-30	0	0
