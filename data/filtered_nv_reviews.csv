42,Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,Oxz26pqpIb7dDVeuUzNZlg,"We had originally planned on eating at the Sinaloa food truck across the street, but they had a really long line, so we decided to give Mi Pueblo Taco Shop a try. Walking inside I was greeted by a sweet young girl who also took my order and she was nice about going over the menu and what the specials included. Inside was clean and decorated nicer than I expected. There was also a good amount of customers eating inside which I took as a good sign. I noticed they had different daily specials on the windows out front and they are totally worth checking out. I was here on a Friday and the special that day is 2 enchiladas, beans, rice and a drink all for $5.95 before tax. Great deal! The rice was lacking a bit on flavor and while the beans could have used more cheese, they did taste good and I liked the few tortilla chips on top of them. The enchiladas had a decent amount of cheese inside and the sauce tasted good. I'd for sure come back for this special again.Al Pastor Taco ($1.75) - The tacos come meat, onion and cilantro. There's a salsa bar with veggies and containers. I grabbed some of the red and green sauce and favored the green. My taco was filled nicely and had great flavor. Carne Asada Burrito ($5.99) - Here's where things got odd for me. Hubby and I intended to share this and he always prefers just meat, cheese and sour cream in his burritos. The girl who took our order said he couldn't have it that way and that the burrito had to have beans and rice inside. If the burritos aren't pre-made this shouldn't be a hard request at all. I saw a different girl putting meat on the grill and then put the burrito together, so I can't figure out why the burrito couldn't be customized to have the rice and beans left off. The burrito was a nice size for the price and did taste good, but it would have been better enjoyable if it could have been made the way preferred. Great weekly deals and decent Mexican food. I'd come back.",OQcvO5P3gH0cuJ-bPXwfQQ,4,2017-06-20,66,67

Needless to say, i left in search of greener pastures. Second stop, the las vegas chain Rigos tacos. The place gave me a creepy vibe plus their soda machine was not working. I'm all for hole in the wall places but this place was too much.     As I drove aimlessly i came across this place, Mi pueblo Taco shop. Boy was I pleasantly surprised!! my  long search of a mom & pop taco shop proved fruitful. The lady at the counter and the cook turned out to be husband and wife, and the owners. They were both extremely friendly  and the food was delicious!! they had weird pricing quirks but hopefully they figure it out. overall, 5 stars and will definitely come back again.",OQcvO5P3gH0cuJ-bPXwfQQ,5,2014-09-05,2,1

1,cQzo2WX1TyPEmS5jPzOUoA,sG2U7rH5NSTYR3-DumVT7w,"TLDR: Lunch Specials; salsa bar available; excellent service; subpar food; convenience charge for card paymentI was really craving excellent chips and salsa so I usually have a go-to spot for Mexican fare. Learning that they were closed, I found something in the area with excellent reviews and was happy to find this location with a Yelp check-in.  I skimmed the reviews and saw several 4/5 star reviews with a couple of 2 star reviews so I decided to give this place a shot. Service was excellent and I was impressed with the politeness and grammar used in both English and Spanish upon walking in and ordering. It reflected that the business cares about the customer and how they are perceived when spoken to by the various clientele. I immediately placed an order for the chips and beans and was happy to see breakfast items on a menu. My foodie friend ordered a pastor burrito and I ordered chilaquiles with green sauce. Unfortunately, this is where I should've listened to the 2-star reviews. While I believe that the food is made fresh in-house, the quality lacks and pales in comparison to the service. The beans lacked flavor, excluding the cotija cheese and the chips were stale. This is probably a storage issue. The salsa were flavorful, but lacked spice. Interestingly enough, the green salsa was the spiciest. My friends pastor burrito was just ok. Not fantastic, not terrible. Just ok. It probably is similar to Roberto's, my terrible baseline for Mexican food flavor and service. My chilaquiles were tragic. The rice was pretty bad and the green sauce was pretty boring. It's sad to say that Del Taco has better rice, beans, and green sauce. Needless to say, I didn't enjoy the dish and I won't return anytime soon.",OQcvO5P3gH0cuJ-bPXwfQQ,2,2017-07-15,2,0

Hopefully that won't change after my random stop there.I had a carnitas burrito, cachete taco and carne asada taco, and a horchata (no not Smart Chata).  Overall the carne asada was the most flavorful with a nice charred taste.  The cachete was tasty.  My carnitas burrito was good too, similar to the SD burritos I miss.

There are three or four Indian curries on the menu. We got the chicken curry. The guy (there was only one person there, to cook and work the counter, but they weren't busy, so hey) said it was really good. If you're desi, you know what shan and all the boxed masalas taste like, and this definitely had that taste. Not saying it's a bad thing, but fresh masalas give a curry an aroma that this lacked. The chicken shish kabob was bland, except for the red chili powder added liberally on top, and it wasn't actual shish kabob. The best thing I had was the lamb burger. Oh my gosh. The lamb was super juicy. And the fries already had black pepper. Loved it. The place is super duper clean. Even the bathroom. Like I said, there was one person to cook, serve, answer calls, and take orders. He told us the others were out for a catering. This is in no way true Indian food.

I had heard about it through yelp but didn't expect to try it out anytime soon. I was taken back by the fact that the owner of the place was not Indian! He was VERY friendly though and so I give this place a 5 for customer service! After having asked if the meat was halal, the owner told us that everything was halal except for the beef pepperoni. I'm very grateful that he not only verbally stated it, but has it written down on the menu as well. We weren't really starving so we placed an order for halal wings & fries as well as the pizza naan (with chicken, cheese and pizza sauce). He asked us if we wanted him to make it spicy, and like most Indians and Pakistanis, OF COURSE we said yes. So he made added chillies as well. Fast forward to the food - the halal wings were GREAT. Spicy, but a little too breaded. My bf noticed this as well, and was the first one to point it out. The fries came out extremely salty, but I finished the majority of them anyways. The pizza naan was good! Especially if you like chicken keema! The chillies the owner added made it spicy and quite scrumptious. The best part of our trip to this place was definitely the MANGO LASSI. The owner gave us each a sample which led us to ordering one. The lassi was thick, unlike many other places you order a lassi, and you could taste the yogurt. YUM. The owner also gave us a sample of the rice pudding, but I wasn't that big of a fan. I'm not the biggest sugar addict but I just wasn't feeling it. I hope to come back for the lamb burger and the lassi next time! Overall, this isn't entirely """"Sholay"""".

Very odd combination of offerings.Ordered the chicken kabob platter to go, and was offered a breaded chicken wing to sample while I waited- they are trying out new menu items. The wing was huge and mostly composed of breading, which is not what I'm looking for at all when I'm ordering wings. Flavor was okay, but the wing itself was just weird.Got home with my food in a reasonable amount of time and it was nice and hot- the kabobs were delicious, and my BF snagged a few bites even after devouring his sandwich. The rice in particular was very good: I'm not one to rave about rice, but it was moist and flavorful, and had some white, some yellow, and some orange in it- likely a combination of white and saffron rice, with additional seasonings. The naan and salad were also fresh, and the portion was generous, and on par with the $10 total. Best part of the meal was the cilantro sauce for the kabobs- it was killer.

They sell their signature miniature """"slider"""" sized burgers at an overpriced rate. This seems to be the selling gimmick for White Castle, luring in drunk gamblers or curious tourists to stop in. The restaurant itself is attached to the casino of the Venetian I believe. It is located on the Strip, with a one door entry point. A long line of hungry customers fills the restaurant, although it moves rather quickly. There are only 5-6 tables, with 2 larger bar-stool type tables for seating. As you reach closer to the register, you are welcomed with a better view to the behind-the-scenes look of White Castle. Rapid hands swiftly assemble buns amongst grilled onions and juicy meat patties, exchanging between different work stations to finally end up placed in a singular order, ready for the customer. A large glass window display showcases some of the White Castle souvenirs that are available to purchase to take home. A $10 coffee cup or a $25 T-shirt? Not for me but maybe for others. Last, but certainly not least, was the food. If you're familiar with the case and recognition of White Castle, then eating at the actual location only provides a slightly more fresh experience than the frozen, store-bought burgers. The buns are much softer and are squishy to the touch. The taste and aroma of the grilled onions complement the meat patty. It's White Castle, there isn't much too glorify about it or expect. My experience was pleasant, but to each their own. For $8.99 you can get 4 Cheese Sliders, a small fry and a small drink. The price is consistent with the glamorization of the branding. I ate each slider in about 2 bites and was still hungry afterwards, but didn't want to face waiting in a long line again.

Also note - my order number was 374, but they kept on calling order 274 out. I asked if they perhaps had my order ready, but they told me no, they had Order 274 ready, and that it was not my order.Now, about 1.5 hours after entering the restaurant, and an hour after placing my order, I demanded that they finally look inside the bag, and the manager who had been extremely rude finally conceded that they had mislabeled my order.Instead of offering anything to help make it better, they only offered me a brownie, which means that they valued wasting about an extra hour of my time at ~2 dollars.If they had merely checked the queue the first time I asked, no problems would have occurred, and we could have resolved all the issues.

I am so disappointed that the burgers were watery, like they were frozen and not cooked all the way.The sliders filled me up quickly, but it was not satisfying.

1,43WiflwfTbmjizIfxvQ_jw,TwNnTZubPbYjUBWGnBa3vQ,"White Castles are not a common sight in Los Angeles county.  Friends say that they were once plentiful, but I understand that they have retreated to the comfort of the east coast. Save this one. This White Castle is all alone out here in Vegas. So, it was on my list of things to see and experience in Las Vegas. I'd never had one. Not even from the grocery store. I'd even seen all three of the Harold & Kumar movies about them. I was super excited. Well done White Castle!      So, I parked my ride back at the LINQ self parking, and hiked down this way to get to the Treasure Island for the Pirate ship battles and the Marvel thingy. It was quite of a hike to thie point. Several times I pondered giving up and taking the Monorail. But I persevered, and this was a well deserved stopping point. The Las Vegas strip is deceptively long.       As I entered there was a bit of a line at the counter when I walked in. The sounds of the nearby casino jingled and buzzed and tempted through a huge opening in one wall. I assume the White Castle is open at all hours to collect the hungry gamblers. Which is probably alot, as the smell of burgers wafted across my nose as I looked up at the great big menu to figure out what I wanted. Looking at the items, the prices ranged within your usual 'fast food prices'.     There was a range of options. Meat, other Meat. Fake Meat. No Meat. All the glutens, none of the glutens. Even Vegetarian and probably Vegan options. I saw a sign for a double cheeseburger combo (little teeny ones) and decided that's what I wanted. I wound my way through the line and got to a register, and ordered one from the nice lady behind the counter.    I was given a cup and a receipt. I took both to find a place to sit. Easier said than done. This place was pretty popular. Eventually I found one at a high common table. I set my camera bag and phone on the table corner to mark it as being taken. As I went over to get an iced tea, I heard my number called. I altered my trip back to my table, and veered back over towards the counter to pick up my tray of food. I was excited, I was eager. I was going to try White Castle burgers. I reached into my bag and withdrew the three small boxes inside.     Hrm. These three tiny things are supposed to fill up me? Seriously? Hrm. Ok. After the yelp photo, I carefully pulled out the miniscule burgers, doing my best to save the buns from ripping. I excitedly took a bite of one. It was okay? I was not as awed and amazed as Harold and Kumar were. I wasn't overwhelmed and taken away on a meaty dream sequence of awesomeness. I was just kinda sorta whelmed.    Even the iced tea was that fountain done stuff. Not brewed iced tea. Meh. I'd have rather been eating a Carl's Jr. Big Carl. But. I'd finally experienced it. Checked it off my list. That's part of the excitement of life I suppose. To get out there and try new things. Sometimes they're just not as great as the commercials.",dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA,3,2017-01-13,2,1

That's how long it has been since Harold and Kumar made such a fuss about these tiny burgers, and how long I have been waiting to find out if it was worth it.  Spoiler: It kind of is.The meat is really nothing special here.  It looks preformed from frozen (I could be wrong, but just my observation) and it very thin.  What makes this joint stand out is everything else in addition to the location.  The burgers grill on a flat top coated with onions to soak in flavor.  They are simply made with a couple leftover onions and a pickle, plus cheese if you pay extra.  No frills needed, or really requested for that matter.  The other options I tried were pretty basic type fast food, so nothing special I would go back for.This location is 24/7 right on the Vegas strip and whether it was noon after a night of drinking, or 4am during a night of drinking - this place is gold! 4 bite burgers that are pretty cheap, freshly made in front of you and aren't super heavy.  I chowed down on 5 of them easily feeling satisfied without feeling sick the next day or really even feeling regret from eating anything overly greasy or poor quality.In a regular fast food setting it would be just that to me.

Seriously.  What in the world did you expect?  As far as taste goes, White Castle is not for some.  I can't hate on people not liking it if it's their first time.  I'm also well aware there are FAR more better burgers available, but sometimes you just want a White Castle that is cooked unlike any other burger.  The burger tasted like I expected, and the cashier, who I'm sure wanted to rip her own head off, was a sweetheart.  Being the lines were so crazy, I asked her if anybody in her team had walked out yet, and she said """"we're soldiers!"""".  I loved her attitude, and I wish I had remembered her name.  My gripe, and why it's 3 stars, is with their pricing.  I know it's a strip joint, but there are other chains that charge their regular prices on the strip.  A few steps down is a Chipotle and a McDonald's that charges the same as any other one of their locations.  I don't care that rents are higher on the strip and it's their only location.  Whenever they come into town...locals CRAM THEIR FOOD TRUCKS for their burgers.  They could have just as easily chosen an off-strip location and made a killing off of us.  I split a Crave Pack that came with 10 hamburgers (we paid extra for cheese), 20 chicken rings, and 2 regular fries.  Large sodas ($2.99) were separate.  The bill came out to $38.88.  I'm sorry, but $19.50 for 5 cheeseburgers, 10 chicken rings, fries, and a soda is lame.  For $20, I can come up with 50 other places I rather eat at.  Also, they offer a combo that comes with 3 cheeseburgers and regular fries for 8.77...WITHOUT A SODA.  That's just wrong considering fountain soda usually has the highest markup of any of their items.  They could've easily included the soda.  I won't be going back, but I'm hoping that they'll open up some off-strip locations and possibly offer the pricing that other White Castles are used to offering...because at the end of the day...this is White Castle, not Five Guys (or any other burger joint of your choice).""",dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA,3,2015-01-29,21,4

I was sure to place my order as quickly as possible (we ordered the #2 cheeseburger, fries, and drink), so at least the cashier appeared to merely tolerate me as I paid. This place has only been open a few weeks and the employees at the front are already burnt out. What's up with that? With so much unemployment in Vegas, couldn't they have found a few cashiers who are a bit friendlier?As for the food - well, it's White Castle. It is what it is. Tiny, thin burger in a plain bun, with a bit of cheese and onion. There's a burger in there, but can anyone really taste it? I estimate the ratio of bun to burger is about 8:1, so you'll have to eat a huge amount of bun before you get much burger in your tummy! The fries were just bleh.About the location - I'm not sure where to park to get into this place. There is no parking in front, so we ended up parking in the Venetian and walking back to the Strip, but surely there's a spot closer than that?

Fish burger- 3 stars Crinkle cut fries- 3 stars. Just average. Onion chips- 3.5 stars. Good breading, nicely fried. Have had better but not too shabby for fast food. 7 burgers, one drink, and onion chips came out to about $19. I'll be back for the onion rings and the jalapeño cheeseburger.",dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA,3,2016-06-13,2,0

This place is like a cheap imitation while charging almost double for it.  First issue is the fact they don't add ketchup like they do at all white castles.  I had to tear all of my burgers apart to add ketchup which being sliders was cumbersome.  Even the guy I complained to who is from NJ said """" we don't do that, even though all of the other ones do it"""".Second issue was the quality.  The burgers weren't fully cooked, since the patties are so thin, this is very hard to screw up.Third issue was the fries.  They were much thinner and far less quantity than the normal white castles.Fourth issue was the very loud intercom, they yell almost every 15 seconds your order numbers.  This interrupts the dining experience and hurt my ears.If you want the real white castle experience I highly suggest you skip this horrible excuse for a white castle and go to an established one.""",dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA,2,2015-02-06,0,0

The meat was dry and it didn't help that the regular sliders were like 90% buns and meat. There were onions and pickles on it but it seemed like 2 little tiny pieces of diced onions, and a pickle the size of a dime. I prefer the cheese sliders over the regular ones.About 5-6 sliders can fill me up really good on a hungry day, so order accordingly. The way they fill up the beer with the magnet is pretty cool! :) Oh, and perks, 10% off for locals with a local ID!I'd say this place isn't really worth the hassle to get... maybe a good place to stop by when you're playing tourist in your own city, but that's about it.",dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA,2,2015-08-29,3,4

1,q6xgj7izoqXoTOWE2QyS1w,N5QdUMI74ooWloFND-CYeQ,"""I had my first experience with the White Castle (WC) food truck at the Great American Foodie Fest held in San Diego. I always heard of the business--known for their sliders--and was always interested in tasting one of their products. I guess I just assumed that WC was like the McDonald's of the East Coast, and I wanted to see what it was about those sliders that made them so great (especially after seeing the White Castle excerpt from """"Harold and Kumar""""). There were pre-organized queues and a HUGE WC tent, so I'm sure the vendor expected mile-long lines. However, when we went on the first night the foodie fair was open, there was NO line; only a few people were in front of us so we didn't have to wait long to order and get our grub. Final verdict: After all that hype, I think I was slightly underwhelmed by those sliders. Maybe it's just because I was different from what I was expecting. Was I glad I tried them? Yes, definitely. Would I crave them late at night? Not so much ... if I were craving fast food late at night, I would probably go for Five Guys fries (soooo addictive) or anything from Del Taco or Chick-Fil-A. But here's what my friend and I got, as well as what I would try next time if I ever visited a WC again: """"Cheese Sliders"""": These sliders vary slightly from the """"Original"""" because they include a slide of American cheese. I need cheese in my burgers ... since I take out the tomatoes and pickles, I can't really just have a slider with the burger alone. My friend and I got 2 for $3 (at least these buggers were cheap), and we saw them being mass produced--in that the thin patties were on the grill in multiples and the workers were putting everything together in true assembly-line fashion. The bun was soft and tasted fresh, which was a plus, but the patty--is that what you even call it?--was super thin ... so thin that I could hardly even taste it. It reminded me of a super thin slice of Spam. I liked the fact that the slider was really light--didn't feel heavy and bloated after eating it--but it definitely needed that cheese. I guess I was expecting the slider to be addicting/have some kind of addictive taste since it got so much hype, but that factor was lacking for me. I'm glad for the experience, but I would probably order something different next time. (Seriously, I don't know how people order packs and packs of these). """"Bacon & Cheddar Grilled Chicken"""": I would actually be interested in trying this slider because it has more elements that I like. This medley features savory grilled chicken with a zesty cheddar-cheese sauce and smoky-bacon crumbles. I do like cheese and bacon, so maybe this slider will be slightly more tasty that the """"Cheese Slider"""" that I had. """"Western BBQ Grilled Chicken"""": I love BBQ flavors so this slider sounds like it's right up my alley. It features a savory, grilled chicken slider topped with smoky BBQ sauce and crispy onion rings. I do like BBQ-inspired sandwiches, so I'm down to try this slider one day. """"Fish Sliders"""": I've had fish sliders before that I really liked, so I'm willing to give the WC version a go. It features two fish sliders made with Alaska Pollock and topped with American cheese. You can even upgrade to a combo and add small fries and a soft drink. I'm not the hugest fan of soft drinks, but I would want to add fries to my order ... this is sort of like fish 'n chips, after all, but in slider form. """"Loaded Fries"""": I'm a huge fan of loaded fries, and since the WC version features fries topped with creamy ranch dressing and hickory-smoked bacon crumbles, I'd definitely want to order them some day. """"Brownie on a Stick"""": This dessert sounds really cute and seems to be a great mini indulgence. This treat on a stick features a chocolate brownie dipped in a rich, fudge coating. Brownies are one of my favorite snacks, and everything just tastes better when it's presented in a fun form ... so if I'm craving something sweet after my WC meal, I would go for this. """"Cheesecake on a Stick"""": Like its brownie counterpart, this cheesecake piece is bound to be the best little indulgence after a fast food meal. It's made with light and creamy cheesecake and dipped in a rich, fudge coating. I'm so down to try this chocolate covered cheesecake (both of these dipped dessert options were not available at the truck, so maybe I have to visit an actual WC restaurant to get it ...) """"Bacon, Egg & Cheese Slider"""": This breakfast slider sounds like one of the best ones on the WC menu. It includes freshly cracked, loosely scrambled eggs topped with American cheese and crisp, hickory-smoked bacon on a steamed signature bun. I'm a huge fan of breakfast sandwiches, so I would be willing to try this breakfast slider if I came to WC when the breakfast menu's being featured.""",dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA,3,2015-04-02,2,1

My fist impression is that it is a bit strange, they have a very precise process of cooking onions, burgers and buns, and it all appears very methodical. They cook on these little square griddle inserts in the counters and there are multiple little stations. Not sure where their beef comes from, but it does look a bit unappetizing when they are laying it out in the onions, at first I thought they were putting on some sort of red square rubber spacers with holes in them so they can steam the buns with the onion aroma, but nope, those square red Lego looking things are actually the patties. I was aware that they only offer little sliders, but I was not aware that the little sliders cost the same as a full sized burger elsewhere (1 single plain slider with nothing on it costs $1.35), they have to have huge margins here as you get basically a meatball on a roll for the price of a Big Mac. (Not that I condone eating Big Macs)We ordered the meal that came with 4 sliders (with cheese) and some fries, and also ordered 2 of their chicken ring sliders. The chicken ones were actually pretty tasty, tasted very similar to burger kings chicken sandwiches, the sort of over processed ground chicken variety. The sliders were fairly tasty and I did like the idea of eating the little thing, and though they are very basic they taste pretty good, as everything cooks in and with their caramelized onions. I did, however, need to dip the burger in ketchup to get a more deep flavor. I felt like they tasted sort of like a basic McDonald's Cheeseburger and an In-n-out """"Animal Style"""" cheeseburger had a baby (so somewhere I between the quality of the 2 though much more on the McDonald's side).The Fries were also pretty good, though nothing to write home about. They are the wavy variety and not over salted. Because the things were so small, I had the go back and order more food! This time I got 2 more chicken ring sliders and went for 2 double cheese sliders this time, which by the way are over $3 a piece! That's like the price of the """"six dollar burger"""" at Carl's Jr, or the more expensive burgers at about every fast food chain, but again even the double burger is less substantial than a single """"$.99 cent menu"""" burger elsewhere. All in all we ended up spending over $30!!! Just to get full here, that is a ton for a fast food place!I really don't think I'll be back to a White Castle anytime soon, it's possible the craving could hit me when I see one because it is a unique taste, but even then, I'll likely just grab one slider to go and eat it on the way to wherever else I'm going to eat.""",dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA,3,2015-08-18,0,0

They basically tasted the same as the microwaveable ones you get at a local food market. Very disappointing. I couldn't even finish the small lil burgers. Would never recommend this franchise to anyone until they find a better supplier for their patties. And stop using microwave food. The fries were ok. The instructions say to """"put mustard on this review"""" (and I wish I woulda put someOn that horrible burger) but I don't wanna sound like I'm trashing this franchise blatantly, I'm sure there's a few that will appreciate the quality of these small burgers.

The place was busy, but that was no surprise with the aforementioned popularity still booming. The line was relatively long but moved at a decent rate. They do well to get you through and on your way. We waited about 15-20 minutes in line. The menu is simpler than most fast food type joints with limited offerings. Think somewhere between In n Out and Chil Fil A. I appreciate this; makes it easier for someone like me who wants to get right to the """"bread and butter"""" if you will and skip over their second rate items. The sliders were much smaller than we expected; again we've never had even the frozen grocer variety so expectations were only speculative. It reminded me of a plain McDonalds burger with the small chopped onions being one of the only things on the burgers other than the meat. The fries were nothing special. Not great but also without any major flaw. Straightforward French fries. Our meal was over in less than 10 min and we left feeling quite disappointed, and overall confused about the hype.

I totally understand that in order to meet demands and keep customers happy by getting their food quick they must constantly pump out burgers and let them sit there, and that's where it suffers I think. I burgers itself was a little cold. But never the less I was extremely content. I ordered almost every item on the menu because even though I wish it was a hope skip and a jump, it is not easy for us locals to just drive up and pick us up a bag full of burgers...no you must be strategic about it and actually plan your day to enjoy this place and it's food.

The manager should be taken out back and beaten! 4th of July holiday and they have one person working a register and a line out the door! Heaven for bid the manager throws a few more employees on registers to speed up the process or hops on one himself! Worst run business! If u see a line go somewhere else like I did after waiting 30 minutes and not moving as it will be a two hour wait just to order!The debate of $15/hour makes me laugh when I see how a business like this is run! Can't wait till the day they replace workers with computers so we can place our own orders and not have to wait an hour in line at a Slow food Restraunt!,dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA,1,2016-07-05,0,0

6,RUa2_2yuSwJtU7sTXz-omA,A6vbq6tg7g1nJkhhJSCmiQ,"""My husband and I had never been to White Castle before so we decided to give them a try out of curiosity. We stopped by on Saturday afternoon around 5:30, it took 45 minutes to wait and order, then another 10 to receive our meal which wasn't too bad.We were able to find a little spot to sit in really quick, the table was clean but the space was tiny. The employees that I dealt with were friendly. I can say that I am glad we took the safe route and ordered very little food, better safe than sorry. I got combo #2 which comes with 4 cheese sliders, an order of fries and a drink for $8.99, I also ordered 6 additional cheese sliders, an order of onion chips, and a fudge dipped cheesecake on a stick (additional burgers were for the kids at home). I ordered all of the cheese sliders without onions. When our number was called my husband picked up the order and brought it back to the table. I opened the bag up and noticed no cheese and onions on the first slider, so it took out one after another and noticed they all had no cheese but they did all have onions, on top of that, I didn't receive my cheesecake. I put the sliders back in the bag and took them back, they threw the sliders away and I waited another 10 minutes to receive the """"correct"""" order. First 4 sliders were fine, cheese and no onions, other 6, cheese with onions. WTF! My receipt clearly stated cheese and no onions for all 10 sliders! At that point I was annoyed so I didn't take them back to the front counter, but seriously, you must really not know what you're doing if you get my order wrong twice. To top it off the burgers were semi-warm, they should be glad I didn't become very disgruntled.I honestly wasn't impressed with the tiny burgers, I took a bite and to my surprise, it tasted just like a McDonald's $1 cheeseburger. The slider consisted of a bun, thin patty, and sliced pickles. The fries weren't anything special either, they tasted just like the crinkle cut fries that you buy at the grocery store and fry up yourself. Onion chips were okay, they were very crisp and had a semi sweet taste to them. The best part of the meal was my orange fanta beverage and the fudge dipped cheesecake on a stick. We spent $25 on our meal and thought it was a complete waste. Meal #2 comes with enough food to fill up a hungry toddler, not an adult. The cost is not justifiable to me, too little food for the price, $1.50 for a tiny cheese slider, no thanks. I came, I tasted, too over-hyped.""",dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA,2,2015-02-02,9,6

Cons: The line was long, (as suspected since it's new) once you get inside, there's another line. I don't know if they still have long lines since people know it's not the best lol The burgers were tiny and had very little taste to them, which I assume it's how it is in where it came from. It was very expensive for what you got to be honest. It was not good at all, way way over price. Like In-n-Out is better lol The kitchen where you can see them cooking the burgers is very unsanitary looking. There were buns everywhere, chopped onions on the floor, not to mention their was pretty brown lolDO NOT WORRY IF YOU HAVEN'T GONE THERE, YOU'RE NOT MISSING ANYTHING.

Yup! My husband has never had WC before so we decided to give it a go. Located at the Best Western Casino Royale, it'll hit you in the face if you're walking down the strip towards Venetian.

And that's basically how a 24-hour food joint on the strip should be.  Be noted that I came here right after having a Filet Mignon at Mon Ami Gabi, so I really came in here with lower expectations.I like cheeseburgers so I went with their Castle Combo No. 2 which had 4 cheeseburgers, fries, and a drink (http://bit.ly/1d7fHzH).  I can describe these little cheeseburgers in two words:  Salt Bombs!  These little suckers were pretty damn salty.   I think after every bite I just keep going for my soda to soak it all up.  Despite the saltiness, the cheeseburgers weren't that bad!  But it might be because I had some alcohol beforehand.  And definitely better than getting them frozen ones at the supermarket.  For just under $10, the combo was decent.Luckily when I arrived to White Castle at around 10:30pm, there wasn't a line to order.  So my experience was pretty quick as it should be.  But when I walked by at around midnight, the place was super packed so I was glad that I just had beat the late night munchie rush.  Amazing!Despite the novelty, I don't know if I'd come back to White Castle again.

Bland I might add. Fries are okay too. The best item on their menu is probably the chicken rings, and they're not even known for that.

5,dsaj_eA71FvpUh49zzKcGA,liaEdz5jJ_4oQeP6w96r9w,"""Simply put - their burgers/sliders suck. I walked in with pretty low expectations and they didn't even meet that. But you're likely going to check out White Castle anyway whether it's out of morbid curiosity like I did, or because of nostalgia. I stopped by on opening day because I was walking distance away and had a friend already in line. The line moved relatively quickly, but White Castle way underestimated the wait time. It's nice that they handed out free sliders as a sorry, but ironically that well intended gesture made me consider getting out of line after sampling their sliders. But I promised to bring WC back for other people, so stayed in line.Great service for a fast food place especially on opening day. Everybody was helpful nice, and smiley despite all the chaos - I read they were churning out around 4,000 sliders an hour, which is insane. I've never been to another WC before, but heard that they're normally priced around 80cents each vs the cheapest you'll get it here is $1.09 with the 100 pack. They can say the higher prices are due to higher rent on the strip, but that's bs - they would've made up for that with the ridiculously high volume this location will do, so they're just plain greedy. But what can you do - it's the only WC west of... think it was Missouri? Anyway, back to their crappy burgers. Yes I know that sliders are small, but paying over $1 for something that's 1/18th of a pound of weird gray """"beef"""" is just silly. For comparison, a McDonalds hamburger (also crappy) is 1/10th of a pound and at least looks more like real beef than this does. The bun was ok and I like grilled onions, but I did not enjoy tasting them for the rest of my day.  I guess it's WC's thing that they never dress the sliders for you - want some ketchup and mustard? Too bad, you get grilled onions and pickles - anything else you have to add to it yourself. Not a huge deal, except that you need to know to ask for it, then wait for the guy to get packets from the back because they don't have them out to just grab. And he only gave me 1 packet each of ketchup, mustard and mayo for 10 sliders, so thanks for that because ketchup and mustard were the only things that gave the burger any taste.  Also ordered a chocolate shake because the lady said they're amazing since they're made from frozen custard not ice cream or soft serve. It was a decent but overpriced shake, which was so thick that I couldn't drink it through a straw. I have no idea if that's how they always are, but a spoon would've been nice. I would normally say well I didn't like it, however you should probably try it out for yourself. In this case I have to say eff it - skip the lines and the clusterf*ck we call the strip and just pick up the frozen ones from the market. They sadly do taste about the same and I think are cheaper.""",dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA,3,2015-02-04,6,6
0,BDmxm7aeWFOLT35gSvkmig,Z9d6iJlJg64ELkRh_8oYsA,I'd like to start this review with a question. On an average day how many sliders does this place serve? Pretty curios about that. Anyways anybody that grew up back east should know White Castle. This is the first location in the west so of course it had to go on Las Vegas Blvd. Not sure what some people were expecting or built up in their minds about this place. It's exactly the same it's always been just higher prices (not extreme though) because of the location. As a Vegas local and someone that grew up with eating here I can say it's good but not deserving of more than 3 stars. PROSSame White Castle you have always had. If you enjoyed them in the past you will enjoy them hereThey serve beer which is pretty cool Dining area seems to be well kept and clear of trash CONSLocation..  Good for the company I'm sure but locals absolutely hate coming to the strip. I understand why the first one had to go here but wish now there was an easier one outside of the strip to get to Size.. As I said well kept and clean but not nearly big enough for the amount of foot traffic that comes through. Some employees... Look I work with drunk asshole tourists everyday too so I understand what they go through but there are some (not all) here that have just  nasty attitudes. Granted it's a few bad apples but they leave an impression. A few times the fries were old/cold and asked politely for new ones and have been met with sighs and eye rolls.

I've never been to one of their locations before but I figured it would be a cool experience, especially seeing it practically get famous from Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle (I can't believe that movie is 11 years old now!)Located on the Casino Royale side of the Strip, White Castle offers cheap sliders at any time of the day. I honestly think it's better than most fast food chains, but it tasted the same as the microwaveable ones you can buy at the grocery store.The breakfast slider was pretty good, though. It really isn't anything special because it's just a sausage patty with an egg, but it does the trick if you want something simple and filling for breakfast.It's not a gourmet burger joint, but it's definitely nice to have one of these on the Strip. The cheap prices and better quality food than other fast food chains are what makes White Castle a winner in my book!

We shared some sliders with cheese and chicken rings along with some fries. Prices were a bit steep, but that's to be expected for the strip. I was surprised that the food wasn't as awful as I was expecting. It wasn't necessarily good, either. I favored the chicken rings to the sliders, which as people have noted are steamed and therefore have a mushy texture that I didn't enjoy. The fries were forgettable, so I'd avoid those.Their drink and ice machines weren't working and people were bottle necking fighting for the one side that was actually functioning.

It opened on January 27th, 2015; and it was the very 1st time in 56 years that a White Castle has expanded in a different state. The 1st time I ever had a White Castle slider was back in the 90's when Costco used to sell them in their freezer section.  I didn't even know that they were a fast food chain since there weren't any in the West Coast.  After Costco stopped selling these, I never heard of White Castle again until the film """"Harold & Kumar Goes to White Castle"""" was released in 2004.  Ever since I saw that movie, I've always had a craving for White Castle.  When I went to New York in 2008, it was the very 1st time that I ever dined at a White Castle establishment. When I went to Las Vegas in 2015, I was pleasantly surprised to see this White Castle since they've only had their restaurants in the mid-West & the East Coast.  I had to give them a try!  This is a cleaner White Castle than their other locations, and it was fun to sit by the window and """"people-watch"""" the folks walking on the strip.  As for the food.., it's your typical White Castle.  Small portions & very greasy.  You always have to order more sliders than you think, if you just have a normal appetite; and even more sliders if you're really hungry!  What makes this White Castle unique is that they serve breakfast items from 5am - 11am, and they also sell cold draft beer. It's a good place to get cheap food at any hour of the day/night.  In the past, the only place to get 24/7 fast food was at McDonald's.  It's a novelty to finally have a White Castle in the West Coast; but at the end of all things.., it's still just a fast food chain.  It's just nice to have another alternative than the McDonald's on the Las Vegas strip.""",dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA,3,2016-01-11,4,4

Unfortunately that does not hold true and eating at White Castle makes me appreciate In-N-Out that much more. The sliders here are very thin, soggy, and underwhelming. They do have a strong flavor of onion as they are grilled on a bed of onions. The price of each slider is pretty ridiculous at 1.29 each because you need about 4-5 to be anywhere near satisfied. I happened to enjoy the chicken ring slider, as it was fulfilling and lathered with some liquid crack, in the form of cheese, which was very pleasant to eat. If I was hella drunk out of my mind I would probably order 20 of these easy. The onion peels take on the shape of a garlic clove and are deep fried.

One view I have is that the bread and meat is not cooked long enough. If they were cooked an extra thirty seconds to a minute, it would taste much better in my opinion. The texture of the burgers are very similar to the microwaveable version, that is one thing that makes me not think it's that great.

I only like onions if they're cooked or caramelized or depending on my mood. I know I'm weird. LolI had low expectations going into this place despite reading other reviews. The cheese sliders wasn't too bad. I would eat it again. The cheese was so gooey and blended well with the onions and meat party. The original one was just too plain. The cheese definitely makes it taste 10x better. I don't recommend the original ones at all. The also come in cute little boxes.

I already knew going in that I was probably not going to be blown away by White castle.  I had tried the microwavable ones and they were okay.  It is fast food and sliders, so I was not expecting gourmet or even In N Out status.  I was just excited to try it just for the sake of saying I had it before.  It is open 24 hours and located inside the Casino Royale.  We were staying at the Venetian which was just a short walk away.  The line was pretty long when we got there but it moved pretty quickly.  Their menu mostly concentrates on their sliders and they have a few slider combinations that you can get.  We decided on 10 sliders with cheese and a side of onion slices.  Each slider comes in a square box and has chopped onions and a pickle inside.  We got our order pretty quickly and headed back to the Venetian to enjoy our food.  The people working there are really nice and good natured.  They were having fun at their jobs and our cashier had a good personality.  I read a lot of people complaining about the size and relative price of the burgers.  It is a slider, that is what they are known for and it is fast food AND it is Vegas.  Everything in Vegas is like a dollar or so more in pricing when compared to another city where tourism is not so heavily relied upon.  Seriously though, lower your expectations a bit beforehand and you should be good. Despite thier small size, those things pack quite a punch because of the buns.  I got full after eating about 4 of them.  The first one I ate, I thought was really good.  The onions, cheddar cheese, soft bun and thin patty came together perfectly.  I did not even mind the pickle in there and I usually hate pickles.  I thoroughly enjoyed my first one.  By the third and fourth one, I was enjoying then less and less.  If you have had the microwavable ones, then you have pretty much tasted what they taste like.  They taste exactly like the microwavable boxed ones except just a tiny bit better.  The onion chips were really good.  I would definately recommend that if you like onions.  The breading is crunchy and thick.  We ended up having two sliders left over and I ate one at like 5 am when we got back from the club.  Still pretty good, but the bun got really hard.  I enjoyed my sliders but then again I came in with low expectations.  If you are not from the midwest or east coast and you just happen to be in Vegas, I would definately give it a shot.

Ever since the movie Harold & Kumar go to White Castle popularized the existence of this burger chain to a wider audience, it has always been on the back of my mind to try it. Unfortunately since they are only located in the Midwestern United States, I had to settle on the frozen ones that they sell and love it or hate it, I find them quite tasty! Las Vegas is known for housing popular """"guilty pleasure"""" restaurants that can't be found outside of their respective regions or cities, making them must-visit destinations for tourists. Casinos have opened such iconic locations as Pink's Hot Dogs from Los Angeles in the Planet Hollywood Casino, and New York City's Shake Shack recently found a home inside the New York, New York Casino.This White Castle is located across the street from the Mirage. You can easily walk to this location by parking either at the Ceaser's Palace self parking or at any other of the casinos close by and walk to it. The location is small but there is plenty of seating available inside. Since I've had the frozen ones plenty of times before, I wanted to order the exact ones which were the cheeseburger sliders. The lowest combo you can get is 4 sliders with fries and a drink which is what I decided to get (having still been fairly full from the buffet from earlier). Once you place your order, you get a number to wait; thankfully orders are pushed out quick since they are made en masse. The sliders are all packaged individually; I can only imagine how many they go through a day. Taking my first bite, it instantly reminded me of the frozen ones. I don't know if that is a good or bad thing. The only difference was that there are pickles in the sliders that are not in the frozen ones. It does add more flavor to it but not much else. These sliders go quick, I can usually finish one in two bites or one if I really want to. The fries are crinkle cut, my personal favorite, they aren't as good as Del Taco's or Shake Shack's fries but it gets the job done. I would suggest coming here if you have NEVER eaten the frozen ones before. Then you can brag to all your friends who live out in the west or east coast saying that you've actually been to an actually White Castle. This place is worth coming for a late night snack, drunk food or a quick meal. Otherwise, if you have had the frozen ones before then you are really not missing out on anything other than the pickle.

What we ordered was the cheese burger slider which came with 4 cheeseburgers a regular fries and a drink. The sliders had pickles cheese and onions. It was soft and good. But if youre a big burger eater i suggest you order their crave packs that have 10 or more depending on how hungry you are. The buns were soft meat was soft too kinda reminds me of a meatloaf in a way but a good meatloaf lol. We also ordered the onion ring chicken slders it came two sliders regular fries and a drink.

We also had the bacon ranch fries theyre crinkled cut fries loaded with bacon ranch and cheese. It was pretty good. The other thing I ordered was a vanilla shake it was thick and yummy.

If you look at the special """"dollar menu"""" items at rival fast food chains like McDonald's, Burger King, Carl's Jr., Jack in the Box, Wendy's etc. and take a step back and analyze how much food you get in a White Castle Burger vs a full sized burger, it doesn't add up 'tho.  It takes at least 4 White Castle Burgers to equal a standard burger (not even a Whopper or a Big Mac, Quarter Pounder, Jumbo Jack or Happy Star).So, to that degree, I think the mini-burgers are worth at most $0.50 each and ideally, not to be thrifty sounding, but in analyzing pound for pound and bang for the buck comparisons to their peers, maybe 3 for $1 or 4 for $1, so about $0.25 each (they did debut after all for $0.05, a nickle each, albeit back in the 1920's nearly a century ago.Beyond the pricing, the food was unique, it has a soft steamed bun with a pickle and chopped cooked onions with a very thin and sort of slimy (not in a bad way) square (a la Wendy's) beef patty which is reminiscent of those Banquet/Swanson's frozen dinner """"Salisbury steak"""" or sliced meatloaf.It's quite tasty and I like 'em where others may feel they're stoner late night snacks, I can see eating 'em and easily going through 4 and possibly eating 10 and maybe even being up to the challenge of over indulging to potentially eat 20... and those statements are both a testament to the fact they do taste good, but they're also not so filling and very small in size.The french fries are really weak 'tho, previously frozen crinkle cut, very thin, small portions.  I'd roll the money to be spent on fries towards other food purchases.  Del Taco uses similar styled fries, but they're much better in pricing, portions and execution (fried nice and fluffy inside and crispy outside).I rate this * * * three stars, """"A OKAY"""" which means I'd recommend it and come back again, but it's not necessarily so unique that I'd crave it and put it on my """"must go to"""" list whenever in the area, which is in part my criteria for my rankings of places that earn four or five stars.This location is on the Vegas Strip in a very safe area, easy to park if you park in a hotel casino I'm sure, congested to get to by car via the Las Vegas main strip, but convenient if you're staying in a local hotel.""",dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA,3,2015-10-11,5,4

Luckily, this fast food restaurant was open 24/7 so after a night of clubbing, my friend and I headed over to this place for a quick meal. There was definitely no lines on a Tuesday morning around 4am, and I quickly ordered one original slider ($1.29) and one chicken ring slider ($1.99) to try. The cashier proudly told me he had 15 chicken rings for lunch when I seemed hesitant in trying the chicken ring slider. I was definitely not hungry enough for 15 chicken sliders, but you do you boo. However, props to the cashier working on this 4am shift! When I received my sliders, I was quite surprised at how tiny these sliders looked. They were about the size of my palms and I'm pretty sure I can eat the slider in one bite if I tried hard enough. Taste wise- they were both okay. They were not mind-blowing and I don't see myself craving these sliders in the future. They actually tasted a bit plain to me, since there was no special sauce included in the beef or chicken slider. I guess this a good place to grab a quick bite if you are on a budget since the prices were more reasonable than other restaurants on the strip.

I guess that is the one perk about living in a city that is just one big tourist destination.White Castle made its debut a few months ago in Casino Royale, a hotel that is smashed between the Venetian and Harrah's. White Castle is really easy to find since their have their own entrance from the street. I have read the reviews about the long lines, so I waited out the hype and my first visit was last week. I was there around 4pm on a Sunday and the line was not too bad-- I would say tops, 15 minutes. We ordered four cheese sliders, a double slider, loaded fries, regular fries, cheese sticks, and drinks. The person took our order asked where we were visiting from and when replied that we lived here she offered us a 10% local discount. Sweet! You wait for your number to be called at the end of the counter. The food came out in about 5 minutes. Cheese Sliders-- They are pretty tiny, seeing how the meat in the burger is about the thickness of about 10 post it notes stacked on top of each other. But hey, they were still pretty tasty. I like the squishy buns. Ha, that sounds really weird.Fries-- Crinkle fries are better than any other fries in the whole entire world. So, I like!Loaded Fries-- Meh, could skip on these. The bacon and cheese toppings were not that special.Cheese Sticks-- I think these things could be good if there was better marinara sauce. The sauce comes in one of those sauce tubs that do not require refrigeration. It has a weird after taste. After reading all of the mixed reviews, I have to say that my visit was better than expected. A lot of people are saying that it is not like how it is on the east coast, but that's how it usually goes. The original is always better. Don't even get me started on Shake Shack LV. All of our mini sliders & fries came out to be around $20-- but that was expected, since this is the strip. The next time I want to try the cheesecake on a stick or the chicken sliders.

Yeah, its awkward.O T H E R W I S E...Woohoo! White Castle is officially in Las Vegas! I can't speak on behalf of anyone else, but White Castle holds a special place in my tummy. I was born in Minnesota and still have family living there, so whenever I would visit, my uncle would welcome me to town with a crave case. What says love more than a giant box, shiny with grease, filled with sliders?Of course, this is nowhere near the top ranked best fast food burger, but it wins in the nostalgia points! Mini sliders with grilled onions - you can't go wrong there -  portable, cute, easy to eat, and especially reminds me of my childhood. Their burgers taste like how I remember it, so they don't do a bad job at this Vegas location but consistency is questionable. On our second visit my sliders were all too soggy for my liking - which is not good, not good at all.I actually prefer the original sliders over the cheese slider since the cheese overwhelms the flavor of the grilled onions too much and I love love LOVE the flavor of the grilled onions. Sometimes I would try to ask them for extra grilled onions and most of the time I am unsuccessful, but it's worth a try. We also dabbled in their cheese fries with ranch and bacon and the crew thought it was pretty tasty, but I think their crinkle cut fries need major work and typically taste stale. I really like their ranch sauce so I dip my sliders in it from time to time. Also pass on their onion chips, the batter is dense and not that great. Their shakes are simple, vanilla or chocolate - nothing crazy, but its not bad either. I don't think they offer a strawberry shake at this location since I would of been all over that. Oh yeah and they have brownies and cheesecake on a stick - just thought I'd let you know. I can typically eat 5 sliders on a good day and it is filling! For a normal person I think that 3-4 sliders is just right. For the overzealous types they also offer crave cases  and crates that range anywhere from 30-50-100! Dang.

The burgers here don't even compare to the frozen boxed ones, and are not even in the same ball park of the traditional ones from NY. They tasted horrible!

So whenever I went on a trip to the East Coast, I tried to make White Castle a must visit place. Unfortunately, it always eluded me, thus making the allure of White Castle that much greater. Even when it made its appearance at the food truck festivals, I opted not to wait in the 3 hour line. so when I heard they opened up a location on the strip, I figured I'd try it once and for all. And no, the Wal-Mart ones don't count. I also understand ones expectations usually does not meet their perception when yearning for so long. Plus I heard it's overrated. So when I tried it, I wasn't surprised it wouldn't live up to the hype. But what I didn't expect was for the frozen Wal-Mart ones to be better. That's right, I said it. I like my microwave sliders better. Maybe they rushed to get all orders out quickly, which is why my order felt on the cool side. i have to say though, I went on a Wednesday night and got my order quickly. So that's a plus right? So to end my review, I'll say it was ok. Worth the hype? Nah. Will I go back? Probably not. Vegas is surrounded by burger joints in the same price range.

Not only were the prices higher here, the quality was definitely off. Where they took their time in Chicago putting these sliders together, things were rushed out of the kitchen at this location. These sliders were made with hate and you can taste it. The cheese unmelted, the burgers smashed into its containers, and the flavors sorely lacking.

I have to say that there wasn't much difference between the fresh restaurant product and the frozen product. I even think that I am slightly fonder of the frozen one. Also the added benefit of there being no drunk people stumbling around the freezer section of your local Walmart gives getting the frozen burgers a leg up on visiting this location which is in the middle of the Casino Royale (a fun but slightly shady casino on the north end of the strip).

I'm going with 5 Stars due to years of memories from that extended experience. This was before things like WC fish burgers and the newest veggie option. I don't understand all the 3 Star reviews and won't even try to. All I can do is state my own opinion. Venue: Very small shop, by Las Vegas standards,  that is right off the strip and is right next to/inside of  a casino. Most easily reached by walking a distance once you find a place to park. There is no convenient parking to speak of. So I recommend combining a trip to WC with something else. Small eating area that was full because the shop was so busy.Food: The traditional White Castle menu is very simple. Onion Chips, Regular White Castle Burgers, and White Castle Cheese Burgers. But, I don't eat meat burgers anymore. So I was very interested in trying the fish burgers and veggie burgers. These are non-traditional items. I'm sure some are shocked and appalled with the concept. I was motivated to give these a try as I may not get to the midwest in the near future.Veggie Burger: Good but a great effort at providing meatless. i appreciate the effort. They provide a choice of sauces with these as they are needed. The fish burgers were a similar strong effort. Well appreciated by those on dietary restrictions. Yes,  I was a bit underwhelmed by the veggie burgers but the chance to indulge myself in old memories was priceless.

Although the service was great, the staff worked hard & fast, and the restaurant was constantly being cleaned (thus the 3 stars), the burgers were just OK and left something to be desired. They were mini burgers with paper thin meat that you could hardly taste and bread that was somewhat soggy due to the pickles/onions. it was a huge let down when I took my first bite. I immediately regretted being overly excited and buying a whole pack of these mediocre burgers!

I was stoked when I heard they were opening a WC in Vegas because that means I no longer have to seek them out when traveling back to the Midwest. I knew the crowds would be bad so I waited a couple weeks before checking it out. But little did I know there would still be crowds and long lines! If you come to this location, expect to wait in 2 separate lines: 1 outside to get into the store and another to order once you get inside. The security guards were a little rude during this whole process, which may turn me off from this location for a while, at least until the lines die down a little.This location is also much more expensive than other WC locations I've been to...probably because it's located on the Las Vegas Strip versus some southside hood. The food is on par with any other WC's and is something people either love or hate. You'll never meet someone that just thinks White Castle is alright. They will either love it or hate it and this one is no exception. My favorites here are the cheeseburger sliders and chicken rings. Their fries suck so I would stay away from those. I thought maybe this location would be different because it would be fresher due to higher turnover from the crowds but nope...still sucks!

In a way, it was my own White Castle adventure.I was able to snag a coupon from a guy about a block down and that really sealed the deal.The restaurant was pretty packed, there were absolutely no seats available, but the line was very short when I got in. I got the 4pk cheese sliders with a drink and fries for about 9 bucks before the coupon. I was kind of expecting the prices I heard in the movie, but I'm thinking since this is Vegas and on the strip, everything is like 50-100% more.Food came out within about 5mins, and I took it to go and ate at the fountain right in front of In N Out.If you ask why I didn't just go to In N' Out, it's because I have one close to home, so I wanted something I can't get back home.The burgers themselves actually didn't look very appealing. The meat kind of looks like spam (not that I have anything against spam). I have had the frozen ones before and those looked better.As for the taste, it wasn't bad. Typical fast-food burger taste, but the little chopped grilled onions add a lot of flavor. I was pretty full after eating all 4 of the sliders.I would probably come back again if I had a longer stay in Vegas. If I'm only here just a few days, I would probably rather have something a bit nicer.The only exception is that my brother is pretty crazy about these, so if he ever comes along on one of my trips to Vegas, I'll bring him here so he can try to eat 20 of these lol.",dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA,3,2017-06-05,0,0

They have the faintest philly cheesesteak aspect to them that I find irresistible.  And unlike a cheesesteak, which has sliced rib eye steak, a White Castle slider can't be nearly as expensive to replicate that flavor.  I'd say they're on to something, but then again they've been doing this for a while.  After all, some movie director even made a movie with the White Castle name on it which forever immortalized it in the bong-resin charred brains of stoners everywhere.As far as I'm concerned, I only seem to dip into a White Castle every decade or so, but I was pleased to see that they have all kinds of different sliders these days: chicken sliders, jalapeno sliders, fish sliders, etc.    Maybe next time I'll get a double cheese slider and a bacon & cheddar grilled chicken slider.

Whether it is the frozen ones at Smiths in the frozen food section or sliders from other restaurants, the actual sliders I had here at this location was mediocre at best if I was I really hungry.Im trying to understand how east coast  peeps grew up on this garbage. This is definitely one of those spots that are severely hyped up because of the fact that this is the only White Castle closest to the west coast. The funny thing is that the first day they opened, they ran out of food! What a fail on their part. You're open 24 hours. You know you're gonna have patrons lined up for miles but yet you just happen to run out of product. I knew eventually I had to try it just to see what the hype was. I have only tried the frozen ones so far. So a couple of my friends are here from out of town. Of course they want to try it. So off we went.Located just inside the Casino Royale just right off the strip, you line up starting outside if it is really busy. One thing is for sure, I dont think this casino has never seen so many people in their establishment. Since it is a part of the casino, you will be exposed to the smoke factor. You cant smoke where you can sit down and eat your burger but yet you will be inhaling enough of it coming from the casino itself. They have security posted outside where the line begins and one right at the door where you enter.So far I have gone 4 paragraphs without any mention of what we ordered. That just shows you how really bad the food is. While my wife went and stayed in line to order food, I scoped out a table. She came back with two craver packs for our group along with loaded fries and 4 drinks. The total came out to 51 bucks and some change. I was somewhat hungry so I ate 2 regular sliders with cheese. In the other craver pack I also ate 2 regular sliders with pepper jack cheese. Now I LOVE onions but the ones they put in these sliders taste like reconstituted onions. You know, the dry kind that has to be mixed with water to bring it back to life. Then they grill it. The smell of it now that I think about it almost makes me want to vomit. The patty itself does not look like a real beef patty. Referring to my pic, it looks more like prop comparable to those fake plastic fruits you will see in some people's homes. The only thing that may have peaked my interest was the pepper jack cheese. Had a little kick to it. As for the loaded fries, I was no longer in the mood to eat after surprisingly eating 4 sliders.Service was actually decent, otherwise this would be a 1 star review. From standing outside to making it in to order, all took a total of about 25 minutes with 10 waiting for our finished product after ordering. They have one security guard outside to watch the line while another one is at the door entrance to make sure nobody cuts. This was surprisingly organized. Too bad that's it. Oh and that they are open 24 hours would be the other thing.In closing, if you have never been here, by all means, try it out so you can make up your own mind if its worthy of a trip to the Casino Royale. I mean, you don't really hear too many people talk about going to the strip just to go to a not too well known casino.

2,swM1TW_7mrPk6UJnTa4SNw,LvEGicfJu29om_9d40Mq8A,"For over 30 years I've been hearing about White Castle sliders from those that lived in, or traveled to parts of the country that offered them. Then, after Harold and Kumar made their movie, I truly hoped that one day I would travel to a place in the mid west or eastern parts that had a White Castle Burger joint, or even better, I wished that White Castle would open a store here in Southern California. Sadly, no luck either way. Then voila! I saw them in the frozen section of my local super market. I bought a pack, took them home and immediately nuked a few in the microwave. Not bad I thought to myself. They had a unique flavor with kind of an onion tang. Nevertheless, these were frozen burgers. I knew the freshly made ones had to be better, so I withheld final judgement, and continued to hope for a real experience at a White Castle location.Fast forward several years and I'm walking the strip in Las Vegas and the White Castle sign hit my like a ton of bricks! There it  was! Boom! A real deal White Castle burger joint right here in Las Vegas, and right in front of me! I dragged the wife into the place and immediately placed an order for sliders, fries and a drink. So let me get this out of the way first, I don't like krinkle fries. And, the White Castle krinkle fries were no different than any other krinkle fries I've tried. So what did I think of the sliders? They were really tasty and much better than the frozen ones, as I expected them to be. These are truly unique sliders. They are steamed with the onion on the patties. I think that's part of what makes them distinctive.Now, if I'm only judging the slider, in the context of the fast food world of large or popular burger chains, I give it 5 stars considering the under $2 price. I don't smoke weed, but if I did, I could see myself eating a bag of these little morsels after smoking a bowl, just like Harold and Kumar did in the movie. The slider is the only thing that stood out. Again, I didn't care for the fries, and everything else was just okay. Service was decent, drink fountain was nothing special. Over all, 4 stars for White Castle, mostly because of their famous sliders.",dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA,4,2017-03-15,1,2
7,BCAr4PSRSvAC_Ev7FLUlyg,wcljx7MelKn4INEwcn9SqA,"What's all the hype???? I will never understand. Upon arrival to Vegas, two of my friends were so excited about this place, so we ended up going here on our second day for a late lunch. I ordered a regular combo that came with 4 burgers, fries and a drink. They were so unorganized that I ended up with someone else's food, but after standing there for 8 mins I decided to just roll with it. I actually ended up with some little tasty onion crispers instead of fries. Now, I will say that I liked them a lot, but the burgers were exactly like a Krystal burger ( no biggie, nothing major ), it looked like a Krystal & tasted like a Krystal. I later had a tummy ache. There restaurant set up is wide open, so you can see everything going in the kitchen area.  The restaurant dining area was a complete mess, I mean,  if you know you have that much traffic coming thru your restaurant, one would think you would have a clean up staff on duty at all times.

0,_UZcVKX9K9ujq93sIVFDVw,HXaFETDCxGGUefLQWOUPhA,"This probably deserves a 4-star rating given most people's expectations, so let me clarify before I get into the review: I have no real qualms about this place besides the price. The burgers are nearly as good as those in the Midwest.So, the GOOD:- Burgers are nearly as good as the Midwest- They give you as many ketchup packets as you want (you probably need to ask if you want any at all)- The place seemed clean enough during a busy night around 1 in the morning- The wait wasn't bad, for the ordering line or for the pickup lineThe BAD:- The main thing is the price. It shouldn't be more than a dollar per burger, and obviously buying more burgers should give you some sort of deal. But it's (as of April 2016) $35.99 for a crave case (30 plain sliders), which is almost the exact same price as 30 individual sliders. Likewise, it costs 30 cents to add cheese to a slider. If you add cheese to all 30 sliders, you might expect some deal. Nope. 30 cents times 30 slices of cheese is 9 dollars, which is the exact amount you'll have to add to your price if you want 30 sliders with cheese instead of regular sliders. That means you're paying $44.99 for 30 tiny sliders...and that's before taxes.Look, I know it's the Vegas strip, so I don't really mind the price that much. Everything's more expensive, and the constant stream of customers proves they're asking a fair market price. Still, I'm taking away a star because that's just way too much money for those tiny burgers. It costs the same amount for 30 tiny sliders as for like 30 full size McDoubles.- The burgers aren't quite as good as in the Midwest. They're still good -- they'll satisfy if you're a White Castle fan like myself -- but they're just slightly lacking. I think the problem is that they use this large island grill where something like 4 people work at once, and that open setup results in the steam escaping. For those who don't know, part of the magic of White Castle is that the burgers are cooked by steaming them over a bed of onions. So that onion flavor permeates the entire burger and bun. But with the Vegas location setup, I think the steam doesn't do it's job. Which also results in less moist buns.But don't let this sway you from going here. Still very good.- The staff wasn't all that friendly. Not that they were rude. When I asked for ketchup, the guy gave me plenty of ketchup, but didn't even look at me as he was serving me. The people on the grill looked a bit miserable. That's understandable, given they probably spend their day making millions of sliders non-stop because this is a hugely busy location. The girl taking orders was neither friendly nor unfriendly.- The menu is a bit poorly done. The cheese options, for instance, are listed as a footnote at the top (are those still called footnotes?) where it mentions that you can add cheese or jalapeno cheese. For those unfamiliar with the White Castle menu, they'll probably just miss that option entirely.- It's WAY at the end of the strip (that is, the part furthest from the 15 freeway). Not as far as Trump Hotel, but past the Venetian. So if you're down near Excalibur, or even the Cosmopolitan, you've got a long walk ahead of you. Might be better to drive to closer hotel and walk. Harrah's parking is free and easy to access off the strip (not sure about other hotels -- do your own research).SUMMARY:Go here. It's good.So why the low rating? I'm taking off two stars because of 1) price and 2) not having the service or taste that lives up to the Midwest experience. But it's still quite good -- I just can't justify mathematically giving it 5 stars because 5 stars would be the standard White Castle experience, which this misses. But going here was still awesome.PRO TIP: White Castles are excellent breakfast food. Let them sit overnight -- keep the burger cases overlapping to trap the moisture in! -- then let them sit out overnight and enjoy the next day.Always consume with ketchup.HELPFUL INFO for the uninitiated:White Castle sliders are tiny and come standard with chopped, slightly grilled onion, and a pickle. No mustard or ketchup. You have to ask for ketchup packets if you want, but it's easier to bring your own bottle so you don't spend your meal opening and squeezing out 30 packets.For guys with a young appetite, you could easily consume 10 sliders. Something like 6 might be enough for you.Women and girls with lesser appetites might be satisfied with 2-4 sliders.Don't forget to try out their other stuff, like jalapeno cheese, onion rings, etc. It's all good stuff.",dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA,3,2016-04-01,1,1

I got the food a short time later and was very unimpressed. For $17 back in Cali I can get some very quality burgers and great service from a well known restaurant that has locations all along the west coast, Nevada, and Texas. These burgers were very bland and tasteless. I tried using the sauces provided and they didn't really help very much at all. The food just lacked any kick or flavor.

I can see why people say that you either need to grow up on it or be stoned to enjoy it.  We downed a few drinks beforehand, but I think I would still enjoy the food sober.",dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA,4,2015-02-18,0,0

You can actually buy the 6 pack White Castle frozen burgers at Target, Safeway, and Walmart, which are very tasty if you microwave them properly!  The only difference from the real deal is they don't have pickles on them, yet taste almost exactly the same as eating in person at the restaurant!On my recent visit to Las Vegas, White Castle was #1 on my list of tourist things to eat!!!  My brother has been to the ones on the East coast, so he told me they opened up the very first West coast WC on the Las Vegas strip a couple months ago.  To my surprise, it was just across the street from our hotel :DI was very happy to discover that White Castle is open 24/7.   My first visit, was in the late afternoon, loooong lines, a bunch of loud drunk people, no where to sit, and crazy busy wait.   We opted to eat a quick snack instead at the little Footlong Hot dog place in Casino Royale, and came back next day 10am!!!  NO LINES and NOT crazy busy lol.  Definitely had to try the Double cheeseburgers, Onion strips and of course the crinkle fries.   I loved everything, Double cheeseburger was great, comes with the tiny onions and pickles, crinkle fries were great, and Onion strips were good.  I really didn't mind the prices, for my first visit, it was worth it.   I just want to say if you are a big eater, make sure you get yourself at least 4-6 cheeseburgers because they are tiny and won't fill you up compared to regular cheeseburgers elsewhere.  I think White Castle is more like a snack for some people...Staff was very friendly and helpful, place was clean too!  I am really glad I had the opportunity to come here and try it out for myself.  It really was more about the experience and enjoying my vacation in Las Vegas.  Next time I come back, I'll try the chicken rings and loaded fries.   Menu is simple and easy to order from, and for drinks they have a fountain soda machine.",dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA,4,2015-04-20,7,7

I live in Los Angeles now and when  go back to visit family in NY, I usually grab a few White Castle in The Bronx and get that great White Castle taste I grew up with.Last week I went to this Las Vegas location and I'm sad to say I was disappointed in the food.  First of all, $3.59 for a double burger is just way over priced!  The White Castle locations I visit in NYC charge about $1.89 for a double.  I guess it being located on the strip is why the high cost?  I did notice the menu was a little different.  I don't think I saw fish sandwiches and I didn't see any fried clam strips.  And I'm fine with those menu differences.  I did like the onion sticks instead of the usual onion rings.  My biggest issue was the flavor of the burgers.  They just don't taste as good as the White Castle I'm used to.  Despite them being made fresh at this location, they still taste similar to those terrible frozen ones you buy at the supermarket.

They dont have an extras section on the menu - for example if you want to add an extra slider to your combo. 4).

Unfortunately, the term still holds true despite of being in this side of the country!  Engorged 3 sliders and things began to go downhill from there.  I'd like to keep this review as clean as possible so look up reviews on Amazon regarding sugar-free Haribo gummy bears to give you a better idea of what actually went down.  If this were your first time, consider yourself warned and eat at your own risk!After hearing about the grueling wait in line for the past several days following its grand opening, we came in around 4 o'clock Sunday morning thinking there wouldn't be anyone in the establishment.  Instead, we walked in to one of the worst mistakes we've done in awhile.  To our surprise, the place itself was swarming with drunk people from nightclubs around the area.  It almost felt like a nightmare coming in sober; as if someone was about to get shot/stabbed at any moment.  At least you can get $1 beers from the bar right across the fast food joint to help you get acclimated with the whole scene if you happen to find yourself in the same situation.  We ended up waiting for over 50 minutes just to order and another 15 to get our food.  The sliders were just as good when I had it in Chicago.

The beauty of the strip is that you could be eating gourmet burgers from super star chefs one day and sliders from the freezer section of your local grocery store the next. As expected we ordered a bunch of stuff like original sliders, cheese sliders, onion rings, curly fries, chicken nuggets etc. The onion rings and chicken nuggets were outright nasty. Do yourself a favor and stay clear of those. The sliders specially the cheese slider was surprisingly very good. The buns were nice and soft without any sogginess. The pickles, cheese and patties came together very well. I chomped on six of these bad boys with ease so definitely order a bunch of them to fill you up.What I like about White Castle is that it does not try to be something that it is not.

Since it's only sliders, I ordered a variety so that I can get my White Castle fix. My favorite was the Jalapeño Cheese Sliders. It wasn't spicy at all just in case you don't like spicy foods. The patty on the sliders are very thin and I recommend getting the doubles. White Castle has a nice twist of an onion ring with their Onion Chips. It wasn't bad and complimented the sliders well.

Personally I have had no urge to try this popular east coast chain but the hubby was adamant in trying it at least once. Ummmm NO, not going back. Lol. After trekking the unforgiving 110 degree Vegas heat from the Flamingo, we arrived at the very well lit White Castle space inside the Casino Royale. The area is decorated modestly and everywhere you looked was clean hence the extra star because reality is, all I can give for the quality food wise is 1 star.We ordered 2 cheese slider combos ($8.99 each) which consisted of: 4 cheese sliders, regular size fries and a drink; Large order of the onion chips ($2.99) the buy 'em by the sack which had 10 original sliders. All that set us back $32+ after the 10% local discount they gave us. The first couple of bites were okay but it was downhill after that, I had 3 sliders and I was fighting to down it. The middle was somewhat soggy which was very unsettling, the taste is indescribable but not in a good way. The fries and onion chips have nothing going on for them either, nothing to write home about. My daughter who likes cheeseburger barely finished one, my husband had the same sentiments, after his third one he was done. My son is the only one that liked it.

And since we were gonna be in town for the big fight weekend, I was hyping up getting a crave case at some point during the weekend. Good thing it's open 24 hours but its location is a little tricky in that you really have to be in the immediate area and just walk over because it's smack dab in the middle of the strip by Harrah's and across the street from the Mirage... I was bummed to find out that this particular White Castle location does not offer the bacon-cheese slider or the jalapeno one. LAME. The bacon and cheese one is so good. Whenever one of my relatives flies to LA from Queens they bring a crave case of that goodness but none in Vegas?? That alone is worth the deduction of 2 stars.We got there after spending a few hours at Omnia nightclub and were all starving. Luckily the line wasnt too long. We only waited about 10-15 mins before we ordered. As soon as we sat down, the line was crazy... We ordered a crave case. That's 30 sliders. We got half classic and the other 15 with cheese. We got 4 orders of large fries and sodas. The sodas are refillable so that's good. The crinkle cut fries are decent. Some are crispy. Others were a little soggy. The sliders which I was so looking forward to were a little disappointing. Not because bacon wasnt an option but they just didnt taste as good as I remember. The weird thing was the original ones without the cheese were tastier than the ones WITH cheese. They seemed to have way more of the grilled/steamed onions on the originals than the cheese slider. The difference in taste was significant. And I was pretty disappointed... Dont get me wrong. I still scarfed down about 6 of them bad boys but I had no choice, I was starving. But I was still disappointed because I couldnt figure out how the sliders hand-carried on the plane ride from Queens and reheated in the microwave were better than the ones right off the grill in front of me. Puzzling... I hope it improves because if someone like me whose """"lightly"""" familiar with the White Castle menu is disappointed, what more for someone that's a tried & true Craver. Harold & Kumar would not approve...Funny story... As we were finishing up. A slightly tipsy and partied-out couple who didnt want to wait in the long line for their food offered us $10 for 2 sliders... SOLD. To the lush couple... Only in Vegas.Service was ok. Definitely no enthusiasm from the cashier that helped us. Theyre probably over it with the characters they see on the daily... Be better White Castle Las Vegas. You should be better than that.ps - cousins from Queens brought over a crave case a couple of weeks after this trip and sure enough, they were tastier. taste comparison complete... I was right.

After my recent visit, its clear to me that you have to be stoned out of your mind to enjoy this place.Located in the decrepit Casino Royale, this White Castle is probably the main reason people even step inside this place. WC takes up a pretty big amount of real estate in the casino but don't expect to find seating or quick service. Being the only Castle on the West Coast means this place is packed; lines are long, service is poor and its not rare to see people fighting over a seat in the dining area. If you must come here, parking at Harrahs next door or Mirage across the street should be sufficiently close.The food here from my understanding is essentially the same as it's East Coast counter parts plus a few bucks cause you are eating on the Strip. The tiny sliders come with a paper thin slice of beef, a few grilled onions and a soggy bun due to the grease. The crinkle cut fries can be found at many other mediocre fast food spots. Skip the chicken rings and go buy some frozen nuggets from Costco, you will thank me later. The food is definitely over priced, a four slider combo with cheese runs for $9. Service was abysmal and place was a mess.While waiting in line, the party in front of us was talking about how they grew up on White Castle in New York and how excited they were to finally eat here again.

I just prefer the extra meat and gooey cheese to bun ratio better than the singles. I also prefer the jalapeno cheeseburgers to the regular ones.

The crinkle cut fries were good but don't think they were any different than ones you get from other fast food joints (just a bit more soggy). The sliders with the cheese were definitely better. They may not seem that big but you can tell you are just putting a whole load of grease down into your stomach.Onto the aftermath of eating those sliders...man what are those things actually made of!

Be prepared to be greeted by two security guards as you enter the front door.  Expect two to four more security guards in the tiny, cramped dining establishment.  That is not intimidating at all.  The GF and I ordered a slider and fries.  I saw them putting pickles on the slider and knew this would be a no go for her.  Sadly, the cashier had already rung us up.  It took an awkward 2-3 minutes for him to refund and re-swipe my credit card.  Sure, it is my fault for making him go through all that trouble. But, could he not have simply told the person making the sliders to not add pickles?  A minute or two after being witness to sheer incompetence, our number is called.  I guess in all the confusion, they forgot to put fries in the bag (even though I was charged for it).  Despite being the only one in line to order, I feel this place can be described as chaotic.  There were so many employees at work.  There must have been hundreds of sliders already pre-cooked and just hanging out, waiting for someone to buy them.  Freshness is definitely not a high concern amongst them.  Now on to the actual taste of the slider and fries.  The slider was nothing special.  It tastes like an exact replica of the microwavable ones.  The fries were average at best.  They taste so plain, and crispiness is word miles away from the texture of them.

I've been waiting for you to come to the West Coast (or as close as can be to the West Coast) since the Harold and Kumar movie. Yes, it's been THAT long. -_- And those White Castle sliders in the frozen aisle of the grocery store do not do it justice! Located in the Best Western Casino Royale, in between Venetian and Harrah's, they're open 24/7, perfect for late night munchies and as expected for a Vegas spot! There's a direct entrance off the strip so you don't have to go through the casino floor. The direct entrance takes you through the dining area first while you make your way back to the counter to queue up and order. BF went all out for 2 people and got the #9 combo pack, which includes 20 original sliders and 2 orders of french fries. Just 10 sliders short of a crave case cardboard box, which meant our order was packed slightly discreetly in a paper bag with a plastic bag instead. LoL. Sliders come with bun, patty, pickle, and onions. Cheese is an extra $6 (about 33 cents per slider) for the #9 combo and was well worth it! I bit into the slider with low expectations because I've been searching for them for so long and I didn't want to hype up the slider only to be disappointed. I wasn't. Flavorful and all gone in 4 bites (2 for the BF). Enough flavor on its own. You can also politely ask for some sauce (meant for dipping chicken tenders but oh well). I used ranch, BBQ and zesty zing on some of the sliders. Even though we ordered and took it to go, and made the 15 minute trek back to our hotel room to enjoy, the burgers were slightly damp, but still good! How successful were we in finishing the entire order? Maybe 70% of the way through. We dusted off all the fries and had only some sliders left.

0,_8QKc8zMtDofWXmHSh1NPQ,d6xXENk0zCpLVVrvJJSpOg,"White Castle goes one of two ways typically.  People are either fanatics or hate it.  Personally, I fall in the former category.  Their fries are delicious, the sliders are unique, offering a steamed variation on the burger.  And the toppings are minimal yet effective.  For the first time, I got a chicken ring sliders which was pretty good and seemed to offer a sizable piece of chicken.  In N' Out may be a little better, but White Castle is great as well.  Having the closest location to Los Angeles, I stopped at the Vegas White Castle for a Crave Case.  I went for the Cheeseburger Sliders, which run about $41 for a case of 30.  Although I remember them having ketchup, when I asked for them to hold the ketchup, I was informed they came without ketchup, but did have pickles which I did not remember.  These ones were not quite as steamed or good as some of the east coast locations, but hey, I'm eating White Castle so who am I to complain?!  I'm not sure that the pickles were needed and as they sit in my freezer while I work my way through the case, I may regret getting a smaller order and going for the frozen ones at home, but so far I have yet to be too disappointed.  And if anything the mental appeal and novelty of having an authentic White Castle experience awaiting in my freezer will help give it an edge.",dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA,4,2015-05-30,0,0

I don't know if the Las Vegas location does the brand justice, and I might be talking crazy here, but I actually prefer the microwave burgers from the grocery store. The burgers at this restuarant are much greasier, inconsistent (one of my burgers came with pickles, the other did not), and somehow lacked flavor compared to its microwave counterpart. I also tried the chicken rings-just your average chicken nugget. I don't know if it is just a western state thing, but they did offer jalapeno cheese which was a plus. For the size of the burgers, they are certainly overpriced-but I guess that's nothing new.Because it's Vegas, they have beer on tap, but it is of the cheap variety.

I think there was more hype about how great they were that made me want to give it a try. When I heard about White Castle opening in Vegas I thought I should try it from the real place instead of a food truck. So I went with a friend opening day. The line wrapped around the building. We waited for about an hour and a half but moved pretty fast considering the line of people. While waiting it was nice to see some of the staff coming out to talk to us and we're so enthusiastic about opening. When we finally got to the front I had to try one of everything. Almost everything. We got the original sliders , fries, loaded fries and chicken rings. Once we had the food to ourselves we indulged. Loved the chicken rings and who doesn't love fries. The loaded fries tasted good but I could have done without the bacon,sadly it didn't taste like good crispy bacon we all love. Annnnnd then the sliders...they tasted just as I remembered from the foodie fest. Luke warm and wet, almost soggy bread. I'm an optimist so I do wanna go back and try it again and hope it was only like that due to the craziness of opening day. If not, definitely munchie or drunk food. P.S. Get a beer!

3,ZngF2uBYrqyFjXd6LvuluQ,gqVqMV6wS_ffSI7O_Nyj5g,"So yeah.  White Castle.  Uhm it's a thing here now.  Honestly it has been a thing here for about a decade.  I say this because it tastes exactly the same as the frozen microwave burgers.  Exactly? Well not really because there is a pickle in these ones.  The location is on the strip in the small casino north of the Venetian by the Linq parking lot. It's very fast paced and as soon as we ordered we weren't able to fill up our drinks halfway before our order of 20 cheese sliders, 9 piece chicken rings, onion chips and fries were done.  To say the least it was not the most rewarding way for me to break my pescetarian seafood diet.  At best it could be said that you could enjoy the satisfaction that us West coasters can now join the likes of dining in an East coast fast food institution.  Not as rewarding as the opposite experience is for East coasters trying a Double Double & Animal Style Fries from In & Out for the first time.  We got hugely full sharing a 10 pack of sliders for 2 and the baby loved the chicken rings though.  We brought the second 10 pack home for my little bro.  Sadly he had to microwave them slightly by then.  Completely rehashing the same old feeling of eating them the frozen way.  He noted that it was cheaper and more convenient to have just got them at the freezer section.  They may even use the exact ingredients at the restaurant?It was fun.  Everyone should try it at least once.  I may rather stick to a grilled cheese w/ grilled onions with Animal Style fries & a 7up next time without the strip traffic though.",dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA,3,2015-02-28,4,5

Because of that movie (one of my fave movies btw), I have also been a fan of White Castle before trying those bite size burgers. Luckily, before they opened up shop in Vegas, I had to settle for the frozen squares at the local market. Now that we are lucky to have our own White Castle, I finally got to try them! I was not disappointed. I knew what to expect and I can say that they taste a little better than the frozen - microwave version I tried before. Still a fan. It's convenient if you're walking the Strip. Once you pass this, you're gonna wanna pop in and grab a couple to continue your walk.  There are toppings available. Try them if you haven't before. Prices are reasonable. Keep in mind, it's on the Strip. The only thing missing was a photo booth with Harold and Kumar! haha John Cho..... :-)",dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA,4,2016-09-06,6,5
0,PXG-QAqIfk8LC7XkD-WnTQ,5BkOQ7X1YPUeybR65FeBbA,"I feel compelled to review this White Castle mainly because of the stream of slightly negative reviews.  First things first, White Castle does not serve a killer gourmet 16 ingredient big burger.  They're small simple classic sliders from the oldest American fast food chain.  People who have had them both crave it and are nostalgic for it.  Bottom line is to appreciate for what it is.  Simple.We went here on a Harold and Kumar esk trek from Downtown LV.  The location is convenient to guests of the Casino Royale or any strip hotel connected to it.  Way less convenient for all others.  We parked in Harrah's which is fairly close and you can walk to the joint inside the casino as Harrah's and Casino Royale are connected.  Parking is free and the walk is less than 5 mins. I've heard a lot about the insane lines so we opted to go when all others are asleep at 5am.  Yes, burgers for breakfast!!  Walked up and ordered in less than 2 minutes and food served 5 minutes after that.  Employees were friendly and obviously over whelmed by the onslaught of customer pouring in all day.  I was impressed they were so positive and that's certainly not been my experience in White Castles past.  The crew were bantering with each other making for a positive vibe which was nice especially if you've getting beat down by the casinos.I'd say enjoy the multitude of employees that are working in anticipation of the crowds because when it's slow its still fresh and super fast.There's a couple of workers constantly cleaning so the place is well kept and clean.  Another nice change based on my past experiences with this chain else where.The set up can make the view from the strip looking in deceiving.  While it may look like there's a large crowd it could just be people eating their food and standing around.  The dining area is toward the strip and the ordering area is inward.  I'd say a good rule is if you see a line extending out doors then ok it's a long line.  Else you should check inside cause the line may not be that long.We had the 20 originals with 2 fries combo for $28.  Just over a buck each which is standard.  They could gouge us but I'm glad to see they didn't.  We have eaten these many times so having these without being in the mid west is a treat indeed.   These little suckers and simple and tasty.  Soft bun, slim patty, grilled onions and a garlic-esk seasoning makes em tasty.  They pretty much melt in your mouth which I love.  Swallow em whole I say (I can't btw)!  Average person can probably eat about 3-5.  We had 10 each.  Don't Judge!!!  We weren't drunk or stoned.Fries are crinkle cut and crispy.  Add some salt.  Get one order fries for every 5 sliders.Bottom line is that it's a White Castle for those who have had em.  The same except this one is very modern and much cleaner than those I've been.  For Noobs, don't buy into the hype.  Keep in mind, where these are from, they are very convenient, never crowded, and relatively cheap.  Don't expect a miracle in a burger and you'll find they are great by their own right.  These things have character like that cool friend everyone knows but nobody sees.  Looking forward to having more next time I'm in town.  Congrats Vegas!  Lucky you.",dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA,3,2015-02-16,2,0

These famous sliders are steamed on a bed of grilled onions with a very thin slice of hamburger,  (And I mean thin. I suppose so that it could cook faster) and topped with a bun to also steam. If you want cheese, that is extra. Your slider also contains a pickle. If you want double meat that would be extra as well. I had order the cheese slider combo.

These are White Castle sliders. This is what you come here for. These mini perfect two bite sliders steamed on a bed of onions. The next complaint I hear is about the price being more expensive then back east. This is the Las Vegas strip. It's not cheap to be here. Let them make their money. It's not insane. Meals are about $8-$10. A damn McDonald's meal can come out to almost $7 or $8 off the strip, give them a break! In fact it's the same price or maybe even a little cheaper than when it comes to the foodie festival and no one complains about that. And this is a legit White Castle. Not a truck just serving the sliders. The sliders are the real deal. The sides are good, small, but good. The service is impeccable. Even with long lines you get your food in 5-10 minutes.

Food out here in the desert costs more in grocery stores and most fast food chains.  Quality and taste? Well, the slider was on the dry side and the onions didn't exist. I'm not a fan of them anyhow and only stop in to see if the fish and clams are available yet.  Having no other choice, I pick up a few sliders.  Far from the worse place I've ever been, but anyone who's been to the ones in NYC will know the difference.  The """" good ole boys"""" here in Vegas think it's a great place to eat and talk all day about """" no state income tax"""" here. But that 900 a year to register there truck is fine and dandy along with all the other super inflated city and state fees.  Point is .....ignorance is bliss.  If you don't know what a real White Castle is, you'll be happy.  Every real NY'er I know thinks this Vegas location sucks. Will I be back? Not for a slider. Hopefully the fish and clams will be here.

I wasn't impressed because a burger can only go so far with flavor, especially White Castle's concept with simple sliders with just meat, buns, optional cheese, onions and pickles. But they're still good and easy to eat. They're also fun to eat. Their food is a cute portion, which allows you to order more of them, or just sticking to a nice small portion that we should be eating haha. Taste-wise: their burgers honestly taste like McDonald's dollar cheeseburgers to me, BUT BETTER. I stress the better because i'm comparing them to McDonald's. White Castle has better buns, better meat, and better sides for sure. Their onion chips are my faaaaavorite. The chicken rings are okay, dry if anything but a good change if you want chicken as your side. And their french fries remind me of cafeteria fries, and i like cafeteria food. White Castle is cheap, which is a plus. They aren't trying to sell gourmet food so don't expect gourmet burgers. They're just simple, small, and not bad at all. I can see White Castle doing very well in SoCal and be highly competitive with all of SoCal's other burger joints, seriously. It would be a nice addition to fast food joints i can choose from. I'm just deducting one star because their food isn't anything out of the ordinary (what do you expect with fast food though?)--but i'm sure that wasn't their goal to begin with, sober at least.",dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA,4,2015-09-01,1,0

That excitement did a complete 180 Right after opening the bag, as it smelled like landfill or some type of sewage leak but of course I ignored it and proceeded to pull a couple regular sliders out of the bag and a chicken ring slider as well. Even though I was really hungry this stuff was so hard to swallow and digest. The sliders are almost as bad as dog food, actually I wouldn't even feed this to a poor little pup. The chicken ring sliders weren't as horrible but still tasted like dry cardboard.

They lay down the minced and semi cooked onions on the flat cooking area, cook and reduce the juices a bit, then lay the frozen patties on top of the onions, then they lay the bread on top and let the onion steam cook the patty, thus the gray color.

Now to the food, Burgers are pretty decent no onions for me, but the onion flavor is echoing off the bun which gives it that classic White Castle aroma. Instead of hard microwave buns now they are soft and fresh and the burger is made right in front of me instead of in a factory  which makes it a plus. Now to the best item at White Castle the Chicken Rings. It reminded me of the old recipe Chicken Nuggets at BK. Reminded me of my childhood which resulted in yet another plus. Overall good spot for the Tourists and the tipsy crowd walking by.""",dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA,3,2015-10-03,0,0

However, it's a way for people not from the Midwest or the East Coast to experience this cornerstone of American culture and history.I was quite disappointed when I tasted the overly hyped White Castle offering at Las Vegas Foodie Fest. It was very mediocre and I couldn't believe that they would eat this stuff fanatically. When they decided to open an actual restaurant in response to the crowds, I decided that I'd have to give it a shot. Perhaps the sliders at Foodie Fest weren't quite """"the real thing.""""I parked at Harrah's. You might consider the Mirage across the street, the Venetian to the north, or the Linq slightly farther south, but I think Harrah's is pretty convenient. I happened to bypass the line (it's possible if you take a side door or just walk through Casino Royale) because I wasn't looking to stand in line at all. The line was watched by private security and extended onto the sidewalk outside the """"White Castle"""" door.The menu prices tend to be absurd, so I was really glad that Antonia R. and Renzo were kind enough to share some of their large order. Not that anyone should wander in here alone, but you really should share a 10-slider sack or a """"Crave Case"""" of 30 sliders with friends/family if you don't want to end up paying $8 for four tiny sliders, awful fries, and a cheap soda.In light of that comment, I'll discuss the sides first. The french fries are really, really bad. They're soggy crinkle-cut fries with barely any crispiness or salt. Pretty much every other fast food chain can beat this handily. The onion chips, on the other hand, are surprisingly awesome. They're crunchy and not overly greasy. They're like onion rings but in a small enough size so that you won't have that issue of eating the entire onion portion while trying to bite the onion ring into smaller pieces. Definitely skip the fries and get the onion chips if you come here.As I'd anticipated, the sliders here had much more flavor than whatever they were serving before. You can taste some savory flavors from the almost paper-thin patties, enjoy the soft bun, and notice the grilled onions and pickle. I actually found the cheese on the cheese sliders to be a distraction. The cheese just obscured the other flavors without providing much flavor of its own. Order the original sliders.Look, you really shouldn't go here unless you've never been to White Castle. You'll get more meat at a lower price at pretty much any other fast food place, even those on the Strip. But if you do decide that you must have the experience, make sure you're aware of the prices and strongly consider bringing a group.""",dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA,3,2015-02-09,10,2

Luckily, without planning our hotel was not too far from the White Castle that we stumbled upon our first night in town casino hopping. It is located inside the Royale Casino, which was another amazing find (cheap drinks), but that will be another review.  We got in a long line and waited eagerly. We ordered a number 9 which included 20 original sliders and 2 regular French fries for $25.99. We added cheese and the total was around $35. Amanda took our order. She was patient, polite, and informative on our questions. Give Amanda a raise. We took our booty back to our room and began to pig out after a long night. I was surprised to bite into pickles on the burgers. Prior, I had only tried the frozen White Castle burgers, no pickles came on them. After the two of us devoured all we could we quickly realized that we had ordered way too much food for two people. There were MANY burgers left over.

I eat at a drive through fast food chain maybe 5 times a year tops when I have absolutely no other option on a road trip. So for me to go & say I enjoyed is rare.My gal friend & I were looking for something inexpensive on the strip & checked it out. She's from the east coast so she's familiar & of course with the Harold & Kumar movies I wanted to try it at least once. We stopped in here. It was packed but the wait wasn't too bad. I ordered two veggie sliders. I was told that I'd have to wait an extra 10 mins or so because they don't get ordered often so they take a little more time. That was no problem. We also got onion chips, fries, mozzarella sticks, & drinks & normal sliders for her. While we waited we talked to some nice older gentlemen who sat next to us since it was so full they needed a place at our table to have anywhere to eat. They told us about how back in the day when they were young they went to White Castle after getting stoned & also told us about the old uniforms. They were really funny & nice so that was a fun quirk of being there.I enjoyed the veggie sliders. They had edamame in them which I eat regularly so that was a nice treat. I'm not a huge fan of black bean burgers so edamame was a nice alternative! I loved having a veggie option available so I give lot's of props to White Castle for doing that when many other places will not consider people who do not eat (don't eat a lot) of meat. The onion chips & fries were very American style & since I don't eat those types of foods often they tasted good for the rare occasion.

There's a part of me that was curious as I grew up in California where we don't have these. Ordering was pretty efficient and I got my order in a matter of minutes.I've only ever had the microwaved ones to go by and there are pretty much the same slider with cheese in taste minus 2 things - these had pickles in it and the bread is softer since it wasn't frozen. I don't know if that is a positive feat that a microwaved product taste the same so you can have these anywhere or that it's pretty bad that I can see something cook up fresh on a grill and have it be no better than what I can reheat at home. Fries were pretty standard crinkle fries.Maybe nostalgia is way more powerful and brainwashy in other people but I didn't really get this one.

In N Out, Five Guys are actually pretty good fast and fresh options so I understand how that can be satisfying. Cheap lowest denominator type of fast food - the type for being  fat fucks, drunken and stoned. That is the only time I've ever gotten any sort of satisfaction from White Castle is a late night binge with friends who raided the supermarket frozen aisle, Taco Bell and Jack in the Box for some mad munchies marathoning while being too inebriated on drink, herb and food to move from their chair. Being completely sober, drug free and  hungry after a long shift at work, my actual senses and judgement was yelling """"WTF....how is this worth a long line?"""" as I took bites from my sliders. I left a bit salty that I wasted my calories on that. These are the type of famous places that is the reason foreign friends think America is  gross when they try it, just by going by brand hype.

Also, what was Harold thinking?Before I go on a rant let's try to find the positives and try to write an unbiased review minus any hype. First off all the servers were incredibly friendly. The menu was easy to read basically pick a number between 1 and 100 to determine how many mini boxes you will get. Everything on the menu is colorful and photogenic. Cliff notes Summary:1. Equal or lesser quality to the frozen store brand2. If your mind is telling you no but your stomach says yes. Ignore that urge to go.3. Taste like a half star better version of McDonald's but someone cut your burger in a square and gives smaller ingredients. 4. When I was done eating my friends first reaction was Can we go now? While my reaction was can I eat somewhere else as a do over for this meal. 5. Sad face. Warning Rant ahead...The HYPE. First to address the hype before the review. I'm sure 99.9% of the people walking in the door watched Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle. I even heard a rumor that a White Castle would be open in Hollywood to promote the movie. False. The closest White Castle to CA at that time was in Chicago but eventually a location came to Las Vegas. The only promise of enjoying a small slider in the frozen form after getting the munchies from a mind altering substance legal in some states was the only way for some people to get a taste. The idea of a fresh burger drew all of us here.Where is the line?... I freaked out thinking... I hope this place isn't packed during lunchtime on a Friday. There was no line just 1 person taking their time ordering and other employees taking their time filling the order. The food is served in little boxes. My first temptation was to order a lot but I calm myself down and decided to start with the 4 sliders combo (2 cheese, 2 plain and fries). Visually, when I received the items it was disappointing compared to the colorful menu pictures. The slider fills about 2/3 of the box (with a 70% bun to meat ratio) and the rest is just air and paper. If only the boxes were etible I would have more food... think a kids happy meal only smaller. The ingredients mimic McDonald's. The pickle, cheese, mustard, onions etc without lettuce or tomato. Only the slider patty is seasoned differently and the bread is like a 99 cent store roll. I can see the appeal of eating 30 boxes... I mean sliders but I rather have a 1 pound burger. Also, sliders are served everywhere in standard bar food and even Dennys is a lot better. I sure there is a disclaimer that reads only consume with alcohol and or other possibly illegal subtances.In California, I am spoiled with the burger options and no In N out is not amazing it's the Honda Civic of burgers there good and reliable but there are better  options.  It's a good thing this place is Las Vegas. I can't speak for the rest of the country but if this is your only option I can understand the love for White Castle but if you've tried other options you will be sadly disappointed. If you want a burger you can hold in 2 hands this is not the place. The location is not easily accessible since it faces The Strip. If you are not walking around this general area it is a bit of a walk. I don't recommend going as a fast food option on your last day when leaving  Las Vegas. I parked at Venetian and walked past so many great affordable eating places on the way to White Castle. I feel like an idiot now, after the disappointment of my lunch choice. In conclusion, just don't do it. My mistake was I had Shake Shack the day before and I ignored my brain that warned me about the hype. Fool me once shame on me but fool my twice F U. If you are a fan do whatever floats your boat but if you are trying for the first time just don't go. There is very little room left for improvement.

The exterior and interior design of the building is very well done - nice stone work on the exterior and great use of wall graphics inside. Surprisingly, the floor plan works very well, especially considering the long narrow nature of the space they had to work with. Having security was a good idea - it helped keep traffic flowing. As for the hamburgers themselves, they were very well cooked. We enjoyed double cheese, regular White Castles and cheeseburgers as well as fries. And you always have to top it off with a Coca Cola. The burgers were cooked very well - in fact they were some of the best I've had in a long time. Some people think they are greasy but it is actually the steam cooking process that results in a nice soft and somewhat juicy bottom bun. Everything was very fresh and hot off the grill.  We also enjoyed their krinkle fries. These were good as well, though I am more a fan of sweet potato fries.With White Castle, you either love them or hate them. I suppose I love them - and the Las Vegas location did not disappoint. Customer service was very good as well. I had the opportunity to have brief conversations with several of the staff and they all seemed to be genuinely enjoying their new workplace.

I mean these peeps have lived on them and this is the comfort food of their generation.  It is so cool, that I, being a West Coaster, was able to learn about how WC was part of people's lives!!!The Wait - Not so bad. We went at 9:30 on Sunday right after Church..... We prayed for a short line and our total wait to be in line, order and then get the food was only 30 minutes.  When we left at 10:20, there was actually no one in line in the street and only about 25 people waiting inside.The Food Experience - It is certainly interesting that you are paying about a $1.10 to $1.20 for a slider. It is very expensive overall.  However, that being said, that little itty bitty piece of meat, that is razor thin and about 2""""x2"""", with the two pickles and a quarter piece of processed cheese and chopped grilled onions is not bad. The bread is very soft and the perfect taste. Not too tasty and not bland. Just right. This little slider will not win any taste awards, but it is very edible and certainly evokes memories for so many.  This falls in line with grilled cheese and chicken noodle soup or even Mac and Cheese as go to comfort foods that is just right.The Food rating - Nevertheless, lets face it, man cannot live on fond memories alone and so, the quality taste of the food has to be key and in this case, the Sliders themselves do not taste very good at all. They are pretty basic actually.  The crinkle fries are absolutely horrible and I would suggest naming them droopy fries, because they lack any crispiness at all. These are the most floppy and soggy fries ever. The amount you pay for the quantity you get is absolutely laughable.  We ordered loaded fries as well and these were looking like some 10 year old whipped it up and put it together.  There is not an ounce of artistic gourmet quality in this little burgers.The Service - Not bad. The security that helps the line flow are very good quality. the cashiers are a bit new and this is taking a bit of time. They are not totally connected with the entire process and ordering and etc.  Buy why? - I wonder why put this  small restaurant in such a location? Horrible location, small, no easy way to get here if you are local.I will be coming back, with friends or guest, but not for the burgers, for the experience. Out of context and just taken alone, the burgers are just as good as twinkies and hoho's are to desserts.

1,Be3feRupSjyWkig3ife-Tg,rxYP7GwV-IWVXXINk7ewHg,"Okay, let's get this out of the way right up front. White Castle is an ACQUIRED TASTE.  People who have grown up on In-N-Out or Fatburger or (insert burger chain here) probably aren't going to appreciate the food here, and that's fine (though, if you try them and love them; PROPS! and welcome to the club). Let me make one point though; it is possible that none of those places would exist if not for this burger chain. White Castle is the OG of fast food, established in 1921, and pioneered many of the technologies still in use today throughout the industry.This is the first , and only White Castle in The West. Like all White Castles, it is clean, and service is friendly and fast. It is located inside a casino, so that's different.Now, about the food; here's what to expect; the burgers are small and thin, and there are reasons for that. The truly unique thing about sliders (and please stop calling other places' mini-burgers sliders; they're not sliders, they're just small burgers) is how they are cooked. The meat never touches the flattop. It is laid on top of a bed of onions and cooked with the onion steam. This is why the meat is flattened so thin (and has holes poked in it); a thick patty would never cook with this sort of indirect heat. The bun is also laid on top of the cooking meat so that it gets steamed also. This results in a very soft, some would say soggy, bun. These features make White Castle burgers unique (well, almost unique; the southern Krystal chain makes burgers this way since they copied White Castle's model back in 1932). The burgers are served with the onions they are cooked on and a single pickle slice. As you can imagine, the cooking and serving method results in a burger with a lot of onion flavor. If you don't like grilled onion, this burger is not for you. You can ask for mustard or ketchup, but I don't. They are also available with cheese. I can't comment on their chicken sandwiches and I never will; my childhood didn't include that and when I go to White Castle, I'm reliving a piece of that childhood as much as I'm having a meal. Having said that, take the five-star review with a grain of salt; it might be biased.  ;-)",dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA,5,2015-03-02,4,0

You could see they were rushing to complete orders and voila when we got our 8 sliders they were not very good.  3 of 8 had no pickles (we did not order them that way) and on all of them the onions were still mostly raw and overpowering.  Overall, based on the visit, I will not return.  Considering the frozen ones cost abo.ut 50 cents each from Costco or when they are on sale at the grocery store, why go to the strip to pay double for an iconic slider that didn't taste all that great with mostly raw and overpowering onions.

What's really amazing is that you taste every single topping. It's like hearing an orchestra where you can isolate and identify every single instrument yet still appreciate the cohesive whole that they become. We also had the warm beets (served simmering in a cast iron pot smothered in garlic, oil and Marcona almonds) and the Insalata, both of which were delicious. For the drink we shared the Triple B. Bourbon, Balsamic Reduction, muddled strawberries, lemon juice, and a few other ingredients that I can't quite recall. My wife said it reminded her of a scented candle...

The chairs and tables are warm dark wood and leather, as are the booths. Nice high ceilings and a beautiful large bar area, segmented off from the main restaurant.That's where the niceness ends unfortunately. I'm not sure if this is a family owned business, but the service was neither prompt nor overly friendly. We came in the middle of the afternoon with only two other customers in the place. The host seemed like he was just wandering aimlessly around the dining area and just happened to see us. The booths are not exactly comfortable, as I think the backs are a bit too tight and push you forward to the table.Quick summation of the meal:Arugula salad (Panzanella): probably the best thing we had. Homemade croutons and little dried pieces of proscuttio topped with large shavings of parmigiano.Meatball appetizer: five small meatballs in so-so tomato sauce and topped with basil slivers. Meatballs were cold (as in freezer cold) in the middle and not especially tasty. You can see that the cheese on top is not even slightly melted, which is rather indicative of the overall temperature of the dish.Salsiccia e Friarielli (sausage and broccoli) pizza. Sausage was not bad at all, but appeared to be tossed on the pizza in very uneven clumps. The dough was also not bad, but the chef definitely needs more experience with his or her oven. Burnt on the outside, raw on the inside. This can happen now and then with a good hot pizza oven, but added to everything else it just added insult to injury.So, salad, pizza, appetizer. $50.00 for lunch. Not a great first experience in the Village Square on Sahara.

He told me he'd check and a short time later, he came back and told me they could make it but they didn't have the caramelized onions for it.  I told him to order it anyway.In just a few short minutes, the pizza was brought to me as I waited in their small waiting area.  I brought it home and it was very good.

4,UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,x6fRx6IOv1FtwIEdpbtfaQ,"I have been a fan of Settebello for years and was excited that they opened another location closer to my side of town. I had the opportunity to have a meal with some fabulous fellow Yelpers last week and we had a five star meal, as expected. Since we had a larger party, we were able to order and share quite a few different pizzas and desserts. We started with Arancini for our appetizer, which was good and opted for five different pizzas, the Margherita DOC, Settebello, Carbonara, Diavola and the special of the day which was a white pizza. My favorites were the Margherita, Settebello and Diavola, although all of them were great. The Diavola had a fantastic spiciness that I couldn't get enough of. The Margherita was simple, but perfectly made and showcased the quality ingredients that they use. The Settebello is the restaurant's namesake and has the perfect combination of flavors, and I can never say no to a pine nut. My least favorite was probably the white pizza, since it had quite a few more onions than I would have liked. It was lacking for me, but my tablemates seemed to love it quite a bit They do have weekly specials, so it's a good idea to check them out on Facebook or sign up online for their newsletter for updates. Luckily, we were able to sample quite a few desserts as well while we were there. The Caramel Budino stole my heart the moment I read the description on the menu and it did not disappoint. This was one of the highlights of our meal for me. Flavorful and a great combination of flavors. The dessert pizza was heaven. Cinnamon, apples, caramel, powdered sugar served on their beautiful pizza dough. This was a great dessert as well. My second favorite of the day. The S'mores Calzone and Zeppoles didn't do much for me. They were good, but too sweet and chocolatey for my taste. That's probably just me, though. As a fan of Settebello for so long, this meal lived up to all my fond memories of meals with friends at the Settebello in Henderson and makes me wonder why it took me so long between visits.",BOQOuwSNhfKx1xvKtONsBg,5,2013-12-16,6,5

The interior is very beautiful for a pizza place, I like that you can see the pizza oven in the back of the restaurant. When we walked in, there was no one to greet/seat us, even though the restaurant was barely half full. We stood there for a few minutes before a server acknowledged us and yelled to a girl standing by the pizza oven chatting to the cook. That's when I realized she was suppose to be the hostess, but she obviously thought talking to the cook was more important. Moments before, a large group had entered the restaurant and stood behind us, and the hostess ignored me and my friend and immediately spoke to the guy behind me and asked if they had a reservation. Perhaps she thought we were all one party, but I thought that was pretty rude of her not to ask. When we were finally seated, we were unable to get menus right away because they had run out. How do you run out of menus on a Monday night when it's not busy? I'm sure the Office Depot down the street can make color copies at $0.25 each...Aside from that, our pizzas were pretty good. I'm not a big fan of pizzas, but I love the crispiness of the crust and how you can taste the freshness of the ingredients.

I am a middle aged average looking Caucasian woman. Usually dining out with the hubby or friends. I like to enjoy my meals out. It is not up to the server to decide that I shouldn't have dessert, and that is what I'm feeling here. Maybe I'm overly sensitive but dinner last night was the last straw.

For me I knew it was going to be like that so I guess I wasn't as disappoint as oppose to someone who wasn't expecting soggy center. I came right when they open first customer of the day. The restaurant itself is super cool, very rustic and stylish. Classy with lots and lots of space. The bar to the left is a great size with flat screen TVs. The kitchen is sort of open with an awesome oven for pizza prepping. I also notice a nice size private dinning room which can be closed off to the rest of the Resturant. We were greeted nicely and seated promptly. I started off with the Insalata Grande which was dresses lightly but perfectly with a balsamic vinaigrette. The fresh mixed greens with baby arugula was simply topped with their amazing roasted or more like sautéed mushrooms, delicious salty olives, tomatoes, shaved parmigiana and the best chunks of juicy tender artichoke hearts. But the best part of it was the pine nuts. It gave the salad the crunch it needed. Wife and I shared the Signature Settebello pizza. Waitress kindly described their pizza as being thin crust with chard crust and """"chewy"""" dough meaning it's completely wet in the middle where you can't even pick it up even if you had skills. The pizza came out pretty quick and had lots of flavor the sausage was amazing the chard crust was something I really dig but yes the center was  soggy. There has to be a way for them to make their yummy pizza with a more cooked and not so wet center. You almost have to use a fork to eat it properly without a fork just forget about trying to pick it up. Other then that I really did like what I had, priced fairly but I wasn't blown away to where I will come running back. Very nice Resturant and will return just not any time soon.""",BOQOuwSNhfKx1xvKtONsBg,3,2016-01-08,4,3

Maybe it just hit me because it was new and I didn't expect a pizza joint to be so nicely decorated. Would recommend for a nice low-key date night with a movie theater just steps away. Their pizzas  come in one size, which I approximate around 10-12 inches round. Perfect for sharing between two people or feeding a very hungry individual. The Pizza Napoletana dough is softer than your average pizza and is meant to be eaten with a knife and fork. The pizza is cooked in a wood-fired oven and I would liken it to a thicker version of Indian naan bread. Wonderful texture, in my opinion. Ordered the Vico pizza  with sausage, fennel, red onions, mascarpone, mozzarella, and basil. The sausage was nicely seasoned and all the ingredients complemented each other well.I made sure to save room for dessert which I think were called Bombolinis.

2,C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,KoZa4WhgaAOtJRYcYLFG-A,"Settebello, you let me down! There was one item that I had every intention of ordering and it wasn't there. That item was a budino, an Italian pudding-like dessert. It's simple, but when done right it'll make you wonder why you haven't had it sooner.Of course, Settebello is know for their pizza rather than desserts so I had to try one. I opted for the self-titled pie the Settebello ($13.50) with crushed tomatoes, pancetta, wood oven sausage, roasted mushrooms, pine nuts, mozzarella, basil, and evoo. The interplay of savoriness and saltiness made for excellent flavors and the pine nuts added a crunchy texture that elevated the rest of the dish. My biggest complaint was the paper thin crust under the pie. I understand the Napoli-style makes for a wet pizza with a soft, pliable crust, but the lack of density beneath all the ingredients made it appear soupy. A good pizza for sure, but my personal preference is for a firmer crust.Without the budino, I decided to try two desserts. First up was the Dream Bomba ($5), a dense ball of caramel surrounded by a creamy and smooth peanut butter gelato and coated in chocolate. It was cut into four wedges. A solid dessert for sure, and one that you'll want to share.The second almost made me forget why I came here in the first place. The zeppole ($5.50) were soft, warm pillowy mini doughnuts of deliciousness filled with plenty of nutella. Coated with plenty of sugar, it's a sure-fire cure for any sweet tooth. If you're sharing with a kid, like I was, make sure you get extra napkins because most of the sugar and nutella ended up all over his face.While not quite living up to the lofty expectations I had, Settebello is a great family-friendly dining option, especially if you're craving pizza Napoletana.",BOQOuwSNhfKx1xvKtONsBg,4,2014-05-25,3,2

3,Gr-MqCunME2K_KmsAwjpTA,t-G0EUb-Fl2fqu5ZM0PclA,"This is really REALLY good pizza!  It is different in that it is more European and rustic than the typical American sliced pizza.  The crust is different too.  It is really fluffy in the edges and the inside is really thin.  This makes eating it a little messy but totally worth it.  Their pizza is traditionally served unsliced and you eat it by tearing off little bits.  Good fun if you are having your own pizza.  If you are sharing or don't want to be a mess they will slice them up for you!Here are some of the pizzas that I have tried so far:1) Settebello: This is the name of the restaurant, how can you go wrong?  It has crushed tomatoes, pancetta, sausage, mushroom, pine nuts, mozzarella, basil, and olive oil.  It is like an everything pizza.  So good.  If I had to choose one to be my favorite, this would be it.2) Pizza Carbonara: Crushed tomatoes, pancetta, eggs, mozarella, pepper, olive oil.  The eggs are mixed in with the chesse.  This is another tomato sauce pizza that is really good.3) Emilia (white pizza): Prosciutto, panna (cream), mozzarella, parmigiono reggiano, basil, olive oil.  Excellent and tasty white pizza.  The creamy consistency is delicious.4) Vico (white pizza): Sausage, fennel, red onions, mascarpone, mozzarella, basil, olive oil.  The sausage and red onions on this pizza are delicious.Basically all the pizzas are really good.  The bruschetta is good too but needed a little salt in my opinion.  For dessert the Bella Mella: apple with caramel, vanilla mascarpone, and almonds was the best.  We tried the nutella pizza (so-so) and the nutella filled donuts.  The apple pie was the best by far.Come here for some great pizza and a food coma shortly to follow.  I fell asleep right after and didn't wake up to brush my teeth or shower until 6am.

7,_pE9wtP4DhTxlPw_fbwrlQ,AUVXSYSEEvZURjPLHhBB3g,"We are absolutely furious with the pizza makers. They burnt all 4 pizzas which is absolutely ridiculous. ONLY GO WHEN AUGUSTINE IS WORKING ALONE. The cooks other than Augustine have burnt every single pizza that I have seen come out of the oven. I saw the two cooks and they both were not paying attention and we're talking to each other while the pizza was cooking. Whether the oven is hot or not, they both burned all of the pizzas that came out of the oven. I would rather pay double for Augustine to make and cook the pizza because he doesn't burn it first of all and the flavor is more deep and the mozzarella is perfectly melted. I feel like I wasted my money and time today because I cannot even eat the crust or the bottom of the pizza because it was all completely soggy and burned. Like what I am left with to eat... The toppings?! I think Augustine should be the main chef at Settebello because he is consistently making perfect pizzas which is the only reason why we go there and gave 5 stars in the past. I will not be going there anymore except on Sunday's when Augustine works there and the two other cooks are not. My point is why should I pay $45 for a couple burned pizzas? Also, I usually don't like to write bad reviews, like last time I was there, there was strand of blonde hair and well what do you know... the pizza was burnt.

They serve  Neapolitan pizzas that originates from Italy instead of the more traditional American versions like thin crust New York Style, Chicago deep dish, fancy California pizzas, etc.They have a varied menu of appetizers, salads, pizzas, and desserts, so there are plenty of options for anyone to find something to suit their tastes. I normally tend to get their margherita, crushed tomatoes, cheese, olive oil, basil, and  parmigiano reggiano, and their Settebello, a pizza similar to the margherita but with sausage, pancetta and mushrooms. I am always looking for a good cannoli and the one that they serve here is exceptional, especially coming from a pizza place.As I am regularly pleased with their food and service, my only complaint is that the bottoms of their pizzas can be soggy and limp at times.

Featuring all the standards of a certified parlor, inclusive of a hand pressed di Sorrento brick oven, all wood firing, and imported flour worked by hand it was perhaps with a bit of gluttony that a the decision was made to sample four of the restaurant's four signature pies plus the weekly special but in the end each and every one was an individually shaped, lightly charred, bubbly and balanced success.  Truly a space where the concept of quality ingredients and time honored techniques yield a superior product it was with two golden, creamy arancini that the meal began and then progressing through pizza both red and white, simple and complex it was perhaps most telling that the best slices of the day belonged to the Margherita DOC with a the Buffala Mozz briny funk finding harmony in the hand crushed tomatoes yet not to be outdone the eponymous Settebello also shined as the novel pine nuts and mushrooms added an earthen undertone to the pairing of cured meats.  Truly a place where not a single savory was anything less than excellent it was without hesitation that desserts were selected and again choosing broadly the rewards were myriad; a creamy budino on par with DOCG's for best in town a clear favorite amongst many while the Bella Mela proved just as well conceptualized as the pizzas though ever more subtle - a characteristic ignored by both the Calzone and Zeppole; the first harkening a campfire's smoke and the second soft and supple but both filled to bursting chocolate decadence and all the better for it.""",BOQOuwSNhfKx1xvKtONsBg,5,2013-12-09,8,5

The place is big compared to the original and they did an awesome job with the decor, open kitchen and cool bar area.  I look forward to coming back for happy hour multiple times.  $5 mini pizzas among other food deals from 3pm-6pm ensures that.

Pancetta, egg, mozzarella and crushed tomatoes just sounded so good but it didn't come together as well as I was hoping.Funnily enough, when the waiter came to ask how everything was and we gave our obligatory """"fine"""", he just comes out of nowhere and says """"Yeah.  I am kinda conflicted on the carbonara...."""" and just walks away.  Hmmmmm.  Not enough pancetta or sauce and the crust wasn't as well done as I wanted it to be.

The bar service was slow...really slow. I do hate to bash bar service, because it's quite often a staffing problem, not a speed problem with the bartender. I waited 15 minutes to get my first drink, which my friend ordered for me before I even got there. The poor bartender was crazy busy until another bartender finally joined her. They were both super friendly. My guess is, they usually staff more bartenders earlier on in the nights for Fri, Sat, Sun.When we were ready for food, they smartly moved us into a private dining area with glass doors. This was a wise decision on their part. This IS a family establishment as well, and some in our group were getting a tad rowdy. Good to move to keep everyone happy. The pizza was phenomenal. We ordered the gluten free crust and it was, hands down, the best gluten free crust I have had. I actually was super skeptical it was even gluten free, so I had to ask what was in it.

He said that they don't have traditional pizzas like pepperoni or sausage. So we just went with his suggestion. We also ordered a salad and I believe it was called the Insalata. It was the simplest sounding one on the menu.I must admit I am picky about my salads. The leafy greens that are used need to be dark green and fresh! Not light green with brown on the sides. That being said, they did use good quality greens! However, I didn't really like the vinaigrette on the salad, it tasted quite bland. I prefer my dressing to have at least some taste. Unfortunately, I wasn't impressed with the pizza either. Yes, the ingredients were fresh and hot, but the pizza was hard to eat. The main problem was that the crust was very thin and with every bite, the ingredients would just fall off. Kind of felt like I was just eating crust most of the time and it was pretty messy. Thankfully, ordering dessert was a great idea. The Tiramisu was delicious and not too sweet. The coffee flavor wasn't overpowering (or lacking) like how it was at other restaurants. I thought it was funny how they put """"contains raw egg"""" in the description on the dessert menu. When we asked our server about that, he said """"Well, it starts off with raw egg, then it gets mixed with...."""" Umm ok, so that means a lot of dishes start off with raw egg, right??Anyway, now I can say I finally tried it, but was not impressed. Fancy pizzas are definitely not for me. I will happily stick to my boring Pepperoni Pizzas, thank you very much!""",BOQOuwSNhfKx1xvKtONsBg,3,2014-07-02,2,2

However the place looks like a really cool spot to be in once the sun goes down and more people start to come through.  The decor is very rustic which is nice and you can see the huge pizza over in the back of the restaurant.FOOD:  The pizzas here are meant to be eaten individually (no large pizzas to be shared) and I'm not so sure if I'm a fan of this style.  I enjoy having a huge pizza in front of everyone and everyone getting a slice.  Regardless, these are Neapolitan style pizzas which have a much chewier center while the outsides are crisp.  It had a little too much chew for my liking, but what made the pizza great was the freshness of the ingredients.  I had the Capricciosa pizza and it was a great choice overall.  SERVICE:  Our server was nice enough to explain how Neapolitan pizza differs from other types and did a good job in explaining their options on the menu.

If people are complaining, they are not used to the real thing and need a trip to Italy to explore another part of the world. This restaurant is certified as well. The ambiance was lovely, modern with a warm, comfortable twist. Though the layout is quite open, it was still quiet enough to hear the person seated across from you. This restaurant could easily accommodate a group of 8 -10 for lunch/dinner. My friend dined here for a late lunch the week before, and he said their Happy Hour prices and specials were surprisingly decent. I will give it a try in the next few weeks. The server was amazing - attentive, knowledgeable,  friendly, and inviting. As many of us know, great servers are a rare breed now-a-days in LV as most act like they are doing their guests a favor in the land of Make a Living Off Your Tips. This was also nice to find at a new, trendy, hotspot in Vegas. (Server was Josh - he remembered my guy friend's name and is unfortunately going to the Henderson location permanently).

All I wanted to do was pick up my takeout; 2 pies and a salad. I gave my card to one girl who stood with my credit card 5 feet away from me complaining to another employee about a previous customer for 3 minutes while I watched her not running my card and not getting my food. After finally handing over my food, I was asked if I wanted parmesan cheese and red peppers. You could have asked this before you went to get the food so you could have grabbed everything at once making my wait less but yes I do. Hot damn! Apparently those toppings are in short supply because I was given two packets of peppers and 1 ramekin of cheese that was so empty I could count the flakes. $39 bucks and I can't even have half a ramekin?Okay, well the front of house sucked but how about those delicious pies I've been reading about?I got home with our pizzas and salad and without saying a word to my wife she took a bite and said, """"these aren't cooked all the way."""" Sure weren't. I knew this because I had to sneak a piece on the way home (to test things out as any good husband would do) and had the luxury of eating cheese that wasn't quite melted. On to the """"bread"""" salad. There were two croutons in it. It was a sea of arugula. Back of house fail. Not sure what is going on with this place.
