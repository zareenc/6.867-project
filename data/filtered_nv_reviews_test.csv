First time having these sliders and they were great. Perfect size. I didn't feel overly stuffed. The chocolate dipped cheesecake was very good. Small but perfect to satisfy that sweet tooth craving. Definitely will be going back every time I'm in Vegas!!!	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	5	2015-04-12	0	0

They literally have no idea what happened to my order I waited over 20 minutes for it, when the wait is usually like less then 5.

I'm not sure if it's expensive now or those were Vegas prices, but it was steep for a sack of 10, onion rings, and fries. And, I was shocked that they didn't have Big Red as a soda pop offering. That's how you order...even though I don't drink soda really anymore. Onion chips have changed. I wouldn't order those anymore. And fries aren't as good as I remember, either is the fish sandwich. Awww...nostalgia got the best of me, but wait...the little bitty burgers were still on point.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	3	2016-01-20	0	0

1	pV8UPWckHwaj7JKI9InAlg	1POwYM4HaphTn1V5sU4_Vw	Service was good and fast.The food is the issue here. I grew up eating White Castle burgers. I remember getting them from the frozen food section. The burgers at the Las Vegas location taste worse than the frozen ones I've had before. The bottom bread was super soggy, meat not cooked well enough. Maybe it was the way they are cooked. I noticed they cook the meat patty with the bottom bun on top. Which makes it soggy and soaked up with meat juice. I feel this was a complete waste of money. I did not enjoy it and spent way too much for something I could have gotten at my local grocery store for less than 5 dollars. If you want a good burger in Las Vegas go to Shake Shack or literally anywhere else. Do not spend your money here.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	1	2017-01-23	1	1

Smart marketing.  I can't say I was disappointed but not blown away either.  The burgers were fresh but I didn't feel too much of a difference between those and the frozen ones.  They were decent though.  Once I got to eating the 3rd and 4th burger my mouth seemed to get dryer.  Not sure why that was.

Burgers were great but not quite as good as the White Castle in St Louis MO. I think the fast pace and long lines of people has staff in to big a rush to make the perfect White Castle burger. If you're on the strip and you have time to wait in line it's worth the wait for a white Castle. And staff did seem really stressed out by the sheer number of people being served. Also price of the burgers are higher there then I've paid elsewhere for a white Castle.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	3	2016-04-23	0	0

0	m1xMvLbNSnd0g0YUXNNH_w	Aerm8qnHaAjNH43DaI3a1Q	Was surprised to be walking down the Vegas Strip and happen upon a White Castle!. The exterior and interior design of the building is very well done - nice stone work on the exterior and great use of wall graphics inside. Surprisingly, the floor plan works very well, especially considering the long narrow nature of the space they had to work with. Having security was a good idea - it helped keep traffic flowing. As for the hamburgers themselves, they were very well cooked. We enjoyed double cheese, regular White Castles and cheeseburgers as well as fries. And you always have to top it off with a Coca Cola. The burgers were cooked very well - in fact they were some of the best I've had in a long time. Some people think they are greasy but it is actually the steam cooking process that results in a nice soft and somewhat juicy bottom bun. Everything was very fresh and hot off the grill.  We also enjoyed their krinkle fries. These were good as well, though I am more a fan of sweet potato fries.With White Castle, you either love them or hate them. I suppose I love them - and the Las Vegas location did not disappoint. Customer service was very good as well. I had the opportunity to have brief conversations with several of the staff and they all seemed to be genuinely enjoying their new workplace. They had cleaning staff making sure the front room was clean as a whistle and that recently vacated seats were ready for new customers. It was also good to see they incorporated the Vegas theme in the signage, including a slot machine menu sign.All in all our visits to the new White Castle in Las Vegas were very enjoyable. The quality of food and service was great. We highly recommend it to all relocated East Coast Nevadans.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	5	2015-02-11	1	0

Located next to Harrah's casino, this place has several guards to ensure nobody cuts in line. Depending on the time of day, you might encounter a line of people waiting outside.We came here at 6 pm on a Monday evening - a short line of 5 people formed outside; when we left 45 min later, the line was around 20 people outside. Once you're inside, it's another 10-15 people. It took us about 30 min to get our food. Once you place your order, you are given a number, and once your food is ready, they call your number to pick it up. The lady would repeatedly call out the same number for a minute or two until the order was picked up. That certainly didn't add any great ambience to our dining experience.As of 2/2/15 their menu was not quite extensive as the menu on-line. They don't have fish burgers or onion rings. We tried the original sliders, chicken ring sliders, fries, and onion chips (like onion rings but chopped up). Everything tasted like a 2/5 except for the onion chips which tasted better.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	2	2015-02-05	0	0

There's now a White Castle WAY OUT WESTThis fairly new White Castle is located in the Casino Royale ... which is appropriate when you realize that the """"Casino Royale"""" is a somewhat divey casino with a Best Western Plus serving as the casino hotel.

You can only guess his level of happiness)White Castle is one of those fast food places that invokes a strong reaction from people ... and unlike, say, In-N-Out, the reactions can run hot or cold. Those who love it speak of White Castle as a holy grail of fast food, and worship the Crave Case deity. Those who don't get how a thin patty, dehydrated onions, and cheese steamed into one gooey concoction that """"slides"""" down your throat (hence the name sliders) can be heaven on earth will be utterly confused about what the big deal is. I had forgotten how sinfully delicious a sack of 10 White Castle sliders are, how gloriously gluttonously disgusting you feel after pounding so many sliders, and the distinctive aftermath that soon follows.

Do not come here, it's a waste of time. The line wraps against the wall and the entire dining set up is one long table top in the middle and then a bunch of small tables on the sides in a really small space. There's a casino right next to you also, but the entire location is pretty run down because it's one of the older areas of the strip that's still left.When we finally got to the front after like 20 minutes we ordered the Crave Case which comes with 30 sliders, which is cool if you have a bunch of people with you. The cashier asked if we wanted cheese and we decided to only do half with cheese. Turns out it's an extra $5 just to do half with cheese! He didn't even warn us it was going to be more, but I guess we should have assumed it. There's honestly nothing too special about the actual slider. All I can say is that it tastes pretty damn good.All in all, I love White Castle but this location sucks. I guess it's cool if you want the sliders fresh, but it doesn't make that much of a difference. Like I said, head over to your local grocery store and buy the frozen ones instead.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	2	2016-01-08	4	2

The reason for my three star is that it's not that bad and I think you should come here at least once for the experience. You have probably been to many fast food-chain like McDonald's, Wendy's and Jack in the box... right? So why not add this to your list?Yes it's a little overpriced but it's on the strip and  rent is high but if this place was elsewhere it will be a lot cheaper.

Although primarily on the East coast I'm glad to see one come out here to the West coast. The line is pretty long here but that's to be expected.

It did not wow me. It did not make me go crazy. I just felt like poop afterwards.It was so expensive (maybe because it's located directly in the middle of the strip), for what it really is. A little slider.... with a weird piece of looking meat. And you can tell they're already made just sitting there, waiting for someone to pack it once you order it. It wasn't great nor was it horrible, it was just blah. And no one told me but they put ONE pickle in it.I know it's a classic, but it ain't for me. Sorry fans.

I mean these peeps have lived on them and this is the comfort food of their generation.  It is so cool, that I, being a West Coaster, was able to learn about how WC was part of people's lives!!!The Wait - Not so bad. We went at 9:30 on Sunday right after Church..... We prayed for a short line and our total wait to be in line, order and then get the food was only 30 minutes.  When we left at 10:20, there was actually no one in line in the street and only about 25 people waiting inside.The Food Experience - It is certainly interesting that you are paying about a $1.10 to $1.20 for a slider. It is very expensive overall.  However, that being said, that little itty bitty piece of meat, that is razor thin and about 2""""x2"""", with the two pickles and a quarter piece of processed cheese and chopped grilled onions is not bad. The bread is very soft and the perfect taste. Not too tasty and not bland. Just right. This little slider will not win any taste awards, but it is very edible and certainly evokes memories for so many.  This falls in line with grilled cheese and chicken noodle soup or even Mac and Cheese as go to comfort foods that is just right.The Food rating - Nevertheless, lets face it, man cannot live on fond memories alone and so, the quality taste of the food has to be key and in this case, the Sliders themselves do not taste very good at all. They are pretty basic actually.  The crinkle fries are absolutely horrible and I would suggest naming them droopy fries, because they lack any crispiness at all. These are the most floppy and soggy fries ever. The amount you pay for the quantity you get is absolutely laughable.  We ordered loaded fries as well and these were looking like some 10 year old whipped it up and put it together.  There is not an ounce of artistic gourmet quality in this little burgers.The Service - Not bad. The security that helps the line flow are very good quality. the cashiers are a bit new and this is taking a bit of time. They are not totally connected with the entire process and ordering and etc.  Buy why? - I wonder why put this  small restaurant in such a location? Horrible location, small, no easy way to get here if you are local.I will be coming back, with friends or guest, but not for the burgers, for the experience. Out of context and just taken alone, the burgers are just as good as twinkies and hoho's are to desserts. In the context of the whole experience, very good place to go.GK says, check it out."""	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	3	2015-02-01	9	7

If you don't want to give us some extra ketchup why not just leave it out for people to grab then...geez	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	2	2015-04-07	2	0

They handled the crowd decently enough and had plenty of employees on hand. I wish my experience was better. I won't return.

1	Be3feRupSjyWkig3ife-Tg	rxYP7GwV-IWVXXINk7ewHg	Okay, let's get this out of the way right up front. White Castle is an ACQUIRED TASTE.  People who have grown up on In-N-Out or Fatburger or (insert burger chain here) probably aren't going to appreciate the food here, and that's fine (though, if you try them and love them; PROPS! and welcome to the club). Let me make one point though; it is possible that none of those places would exist if not for this burger chain. White Castle is the OG of fast food, established in 1921, and pioneered many of the technologies still in use today throughout the industry.This is the first , and only White Castle in The West. Like all White Castles, it is clean, and service is friendly and fast. It is located inside a casino, so that's different.Now, about the food; here's what to expect; the burgers are small and thin, and there are reasons for that. The truly unique thing about sliders (and please stop calling other places' mini-burgers sliders; they're not sliders, they're just small burgers) is how they are cooked. The meat never touches the flattop. It is laid on top of a bed of onions and cooked with the onion steam. This is why the meat is flattened so thin (and has holes poked in it); a thick patty would never cook with this sort of indirect heat. The bun is also laid on top of the cooking meat so that it gets steamed also. This results in a very soft, some would say soggy, bun. These features make White Castle burgers unique (well, almost unique; the southern Krystal chain makes burgers this way since they copied White Castle's model back in 1932). The burgers are served with the onions they are cooked on and a single pickle slice. As you can imagine, the cooking and serving method results in a burger with a lot of onion flavor. If you don't like grilled onion, this burger is not for you. You can ask for mustard or ketchup, but I don't. They are also available with cheese. I can't comment on their chicken sandwiches and I never will; my childhood didn't include that and when I go to White Castle, I'm reliving a piece of that childhood as much as I'm having a meal. Having said that, take the five-star review with a grain of salt; it might be biased.  ;-)	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	5	2015-03-02	4	0

I was interested in going to this place after I watched itsjudytime's (Youtuber) husband, Benji raved about it when him and Judy came to Vegas.To be honest, it's not worth the hype. People say this place is pretty bomb since it's an East Coast branch but it was all right.The portion is super small so you def have to get some more items if you're hungry.I got the regular sandwich (with buns and sausage link pattie) and loaded fries. The loaded fries tasted much better because it had a nacho cheese sauce with bacon. Other than that, if you're into trying something new. But I would pass!

So, we ordered, food came quick, and I was really disappointed. It tasted like meatloaf burgers. Maybe I'm just not a fan of tiny sliders. The other issue I have is the amount of trash that is produced.

I had been told not to expect much from White Castle from my friends, but even setting a low bar I was dissapointed. I ordered the #2 meal, which is a drink, fries, and 4 cheese sliders for $9.72. First mistake: I didn't realize the sliders come with pickles and onions. It was my fault, although they were not pictured or described on the menu. I was starving, so I brushed the undesired condiments off my sliders. Sadly, I only made it through 3 sliders before my stomach started to hurt. I feel a little sick. so I decided to toss the last slider and call it a night.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	2	2016-10-08	0	0

0	M46t0gV5doOlr87TZHPfrw	7o4VmXU-Cwl5ftvS-PSgAQ	These sliders are really good for DRUNK MUNCHIES.Here you have dehydrated onions that are soaked the thrown onto a hot flat top grill.  From here they put on the meat patties, which in turn get STEAMED instead of developing a nice brown crust... You're basically eating an entirely steamed slider that is extremely bland.  The bread was so soggy that it was falling apart.  The meat itself felt like mush and the onions would have been better if they were caramelized.Not a fan of this place at all.OVERALL:  I would definitely recommend anyone to try this just to be aware of what is offered, but I just don't see myself coming back unless I'm walking around the strip late at night drunk and have the munchies.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	1	2015-03-06	1	0

0	4_mc5xJhrxqUxHsqyDZqRw	sFg0e7lUgJFjj68_r5cpMA	Having grown up in NYC and I can remember when the burgers were 8 cents, I remember being so excited when White Castle started selling frozen sliders in Costco and then grocery stores.  I personally think the frozen ones are better than the ones I had yesterday from the new location on the strip.  At 2AM we still waited at least 15 minutes.  All we ordered were regular burgers.  You could see they were rushing to complete orders and voila when we got our 8 sliders they were not very good.  3 of 8 had no pickles (we did not order them that way) and on all of them the onions were still mostly raw and overpowering.  Overall, based on the visit, I will not return.  Considering the frozen ones cost abo.ut 50 cents each from Costco or when they are on sale at the grocery store, why go to the strip to pay double for an iconic slider that didn't taste all that great with mostly raw and overpowering onions.  This is a post script:  I just came home from Sam's Club where I purchased 18 White Castle Cheeseburgers for about $11 and they are way better than the sliders we got on the strip a few weeks ago.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	2	2015-02-14	0	0

2	p2lzjUMFdYAx77KNVkZSfA	Ld8CsbLYLdpO3YuUhtFACA	Eh So I have always wanted to try white castle. I guess walking by the White Castle on the strip and having no idea it was here was similar to someone coming out to California excited to try in n out. I can't really explain the feeling of silly excitement to try fast food? It's almost embarrassing to admit. Regardless on an impulse I went in with my friends, and waited in the ridiculously long line with a single cashier to place our order. We were looking for more of a snack and attempting to just try everything. Sliders, chicken rings, fries, and cheesecake stick is what we ordered to snack on. Didn't realize there were pickles on the sliders, which I guess is my fault for not being more cautious, so that first bite made me cringe. However once I removed the green devil slice and got into the slider I was...well still not impressed. It's hard to judge a fast food place like a high class restaurant, but I was still disappointing. The slider was very akin to a McDonalds burger, and the chicken was airated. Fries were crinkle and a little bit cold which was upsetting. If I had one close by I dont see myself ever really going over the other fast food chains which just are better.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	3	2016-01-20	1	1

I am somewhat of a regular here and need to get in the habit of checking-in,  but I typically get a Settebello pizza, unsliced, with spicy oil.  The reason for this, and after tasting all of the pizze on the menu, the Settebello has, by far, the best flavor combo if you're into a more savory, earthy flavor in pizza.  My favorite in Las Vegas and the US, period.  This is what real pizza, not greasy NY or Chicago style bs pizza, should and does taste like.	BOQOuwSNhfKx1xvKtONsBg	5	2015-04-25	1	2

I think we've been holding off because we thought it was going to be expensive, but it really isn't. 2 salads, a pizza and a cocktail came to roughly $40. The food is excellent and the pizza is very different than we're used to but very fresh and delicious (and the sauce is amazing!). The crust is really thin, airy and light, but not hard, crunchy or crispy like you might expect a thin crust to be.We had the Diavola pizza which had crushed tomatoes, garlic, basil, bell peppers, peppered salami, crushed red peppers, etc. So incredibly flavorful and delicious. What's really amazing is that you taste every single topping. It's like hearing an orchestra where you can isolate and identify every single instrument yet still appreciate the cohesive whole that they become. We also had the warm beets (served simmering in a cast iron pot smothered in garlic, oil and Marcona almonds) and the Insalata, both of which were delicious. For the drink we shared the Triple B. Bourbon, Balsamic Reduction, muddled strawberries, lemon juice, and a few other ingredients that I can't quite recall. My wife said it reminded her of a scented candle... Not sure I agree but we both thought it was great! The atmosphere is also nice. Comfortable, cozy, warm and inviting with a nice energy. This is definitely a place that we'll come back to.UPDATE: We've been back 3 more times now and we've never gotten the same dish twice, we always try something new. We have yet to be disappointed!

I believe in Italy, they put the basil on after the pizza comes out of the oven.

Once she greeted us it took at the most about 5 minutes before we were seated. Not long at all. We ordered a mixed green salad and margeretta pizza with no basil. I didn't read the part on the menu that said the salad would only be drizzled with oil. My bad. Had I seen it I would of asked for vinegar. The salad was good. The pizza was on a super thin crust which is what I like. A little crunchy. Fresh tomato sauce. Portion wise wasn't too bad either. We were able to split the pizza and salad between two people and walk out full.	BOQOuwSNhfKx1xvKtONsBg	3	2015-02-21	0	0

The chairs and tables are warm dark wood and leather, as are the booths. Nice high ceilings and a beautiful large bar area, segmented off from the main restaurant.That's where the niceness ends unfortunately. I'm not sure if this is a family owned business, but the service was neither prompt nor overly friendly. We came in the middle of the afternoon with only two other customers in the place. The host seemed like he was just wandering aimlessly around the dining area and just happened to see us. The booths are not exactly comfortable, as I think the backs are a bit too tight and push you forward to the table.Quick summation of the meal:Arugula salad (Panzanella): probably the best thing we had. Homemade croutons and little dried pieces of proscuttio topped with large shavings of parmigiano.Meatball appetizer: five small meatballs in so-so tomato sauce and topped with basil slivers. Meatballs were cold (as in freezer cold) in the middle and not especially tasty. You can see that the cheese on top is not even slightly melted, which is rather indicative of the overall temperature of the dish.Salsiccia e Friarielli (sausage and broccoli) pizza. Sausage was not bad at all, but appeared to be tossed on the pizza in very uneven clumps. The dough was also not bad, but the chef definitely needs more experience with his or her oven. Burnt on the outside, raw on the inside. This can happen now and then with a good hot pizza oven, but added to everything else it just added insult to injury.So, salad, pizza, appetizer. $50.00 for lunch. Not a great first experience in the Village Square on Sahara. We might visit Settebello Pizzeria Napoletana sometime in the future, but it might take a few months to get the bad taste out of my mouth.	BOQOuwSNhfKx1xvKtONsBg	2	2015-03-21	1	1

4	SfY0jEFqBkrqq9bVi6P31Q	vrroVxyppLn1Zm-hpLMRSg	I've really come to appreciate VPN style pizza. Because of the high quality ingredients, it truly distinguishes this pizza apart from any other pizzeria. Imported flour from Napoli, San Marzano tomatoes, meats from various American distributers and Buffalo Mozzarella give this place the ingredients to make one hell of a pizza. What we ordered:Arancini appetizer- not the best I've had, but I came here for pizza.Margherita DOCCrushed Tomatoes, Fresh Buffalo Mozzarella, Basil, Parmigiano Reggiano, Extra Virgin Olive Oil. Simple yet exquisite. Yes I just used that word to describe pizza. Truly my favorite pizza here.DiavolaCrushed Tomatoes, Finnochiona (Peppered Salame), Roasted Red Bell Peppers, Crushed Red Peppers, Garlic, Mozzarella, Extra Virgin Olive Oil. This definitely had a bite to it, I like spicy food, the peppered salame gave it a delicious spice to it.Pizza CarbonaraCrushed Tomatoes, Pancetta, Egg, Mozzarella, Cracked Pepper, Extra Virgin Olive OilMy very pizza with egg on it that I liked. I was a bit surprised myself. The oven cooked the egg perfectly to blend with the rest of the ingredients. This was an excellent slice of pie.SettebelloCrushed Tomatoes, Pancetta, Wood Oven Sausage, Roasted Mushrooms, Toasted Pine Nuts, Mozzarella, Basil, Extra Virgin Olive Oil. Still a classic. Along with the DOC, this is a staple when ordering here. Not usually a fan of sausage of pizza, but a total exception to my rule here.Pizza Special: Rafael (different special weekly)Mozzarella, Salame, Roasted Onion, Garlic, Oregano, Red Pepper Flakes, Basil, Parmigiana, EVOO. Excellent! This was my second favorite pizza sampled that day. Caramel Budino-very sweet, if you like caramel, this is the dessert for you.S'mores Calzone-it was essentially chocolate chips melted within a calzone.Bella Mella-Dessert Pizza was excellent, cinnamon apples and mascarpone was delish.Zeppole-nutella filled donuts. Need I say more? This was my favorite dessert out of the four we tried.For a true hand crafted pizza, this is the place I will come. Being the only VPN certified place in town, Settebello stands out from other pizzerias. Sign up to be on the email list and be notified of their weekly pizza special.*Sidenote, I really wish people would stop complaining about the pizza being undercooked and/or wet. This is what VPN style pizza is, it's not Chicago style, it's not New York style. Grimaldi lovers probably won't appreciate this style of pizza.	BOQOuwSNhfKx1xvKtONsBg	5	2013-12-16	11	6

Settebello is an up and coming gem of the Summerlin area.The staff, from the manager, to the bartenders and servers, is friendly, down-to-earth and diligent. The food is amazing. The pizza reminds me of stopping at that random family-owned restaurant along the streets of Florence or Rome. (They have high quality olive oil which is always a tell-tale sign) They have a great wine and cocktail selection. (Best old-fashioned in Vegas, tied with Herbs and Rye)And their Happy Hour tops the whole thing off.This place is really great, I recommend it for everyone, whether its a family dinner or pizza and wine with your friends or significant other.

Not sure whether it's because we got some of the """"cheaper"""" options (the Monday $5 Margarita pizza) and the happy hour pizza...the pizzas left much to be desired. We got the mini sausage pizza on the happy hour menu. They didn't do a good job at all of spreading the cheese evenly on the pizza -- in fact, one slice didn't have any cheese at all!? There was only one piece of basil. The margarita pizza was just as pitiful...the cheese was really only on half the pizza, only one piece of basil (basil is kind of a key part of a margarita pizza!?), and worst of all the bottom of the pizza was completely soggy. The pizza -- I mean dough with tomato sauce (and maybe a tiny piece of cheese) -- was pretty much falling apart as I was eating it. We also got drinks. I thought that their mule was fine, but my friend ordered the Old Fashioned and felt like they kind of skimped on that drink. More than half of the drink was a giant ice cube. The one redeeming thing is that their sausage is actually pretty good."""	BOQOuwSNhfKx1xvKtONsBg	2	2017-03-06	0	0

Very unimpressed with their staff. Never asked how the meal was because then we could have told them that it was quite cold where we were sitting. The table although nice for atmosphere, is very unsanitary since it's unfinished wood. My friend when she was dishing up ur own salad dropped several pieces of salad as well as pine nuts etc and they just settle into the nooks and crannies of this table. I will say that they do give you a lot of whatever toppings are listed for that pizza, are on that pizza. We had the settebello pizza and it did have plenty of sausage and mushrooms and pine nuts on it however not too much cheese. But all in all it did come with the variety of toppings that was stated on the menu. I'm glad I was warned about the pie being wet, that is not my preferred style however this was the style and it was something that I was aware of. All in all a so-so experience	BOQOuwSNhfKx1xvKtONsBg	3	2015-12-20	0	0

2	eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A	A86smDnsjgVtDiMgOOUQ0A	Ok, without being the stick in the mud, I do admit that I am NOT really a fan of this style pizza.  It is supposed to be watery/runny/wet etc, and I don't really like that personally.  I've had it a few times, and even recently just to give it one more chance...but it's just not for ME. With that being said, I will review JUST the DESSERTS lol :Zeppole ($5.50): Fried Mini Donuts filled with Nutella & coated w/ Sugar. AMAZING! It doesn't get much better than this guys!!  I think about these every so often...I'd come back just for the Zeppole :)Bella Mela ($7): Vanilla Mascarpone, Cinnamon Apples, Caramel Sauce, Powdered Sugar & Almonds. Delicious combination! Loved the crunchy apples and the caramel sauce.  Recommended.Caramel Budino ($7): Caramel Pudding, Salted Caramel Sauce, Whipped Cream & Almond Orange Cookie. This was very sweet with all the caramel combined together but very tasty!  Just beware if you aren't a fan of overly sweet desserts.S'mores Calzone ($7): Filled with Chocolate, Marshmallow & Powdered Sugar. Very sweet...super chocolaty. This was the least favorite dessert out of the 4 we tried. So a cool trendy spot with a specific style of pizza that isn't for everyone...but at least the desserts are yummy!

0	XB3jLxGXzD7euz3cGKdkMw	7Od-J1mRPSRhKzu6Ypfolg	Came in to try out their happy hour. They have two times 3-6 and 830-close. The table ordered Moscow mules ($5), arancini ($5), Diavola pizzette ($5), Vico pizzette ($5), and a Emilia pizzette ($5). This was a great way to try out the different pizzas they had to offer. There were two arancini that came with the order. The crust was delightfully crunchy and crisp which complimented the fluffy filling and tangy marinara sauce. (4/5)The diavola pizzette was topped with crushed tomatoes, peppered salame, roasted red bell pepper, crush red pepper, garlic, mozz, and some evoo. Unfortunately with the amount of toppings, the dough of the pizza soaked it all in and became a mush when I bit into the slice. It was more of a salad with a charred crust. (2/5)My favorite from the pizzette as was the Vico. Toppings on the Vico included sausage, red onion, mascarpone, basil, mozz, evoo, and roasted fennel. The pizza managed to stay in one piece when picked up unlike the diavola. The texture was awesome with the creaminess of the mascarpone mixed with the succulent sausage and the crunch of the roasted fennel. I would come back for this pizza! (4.5/5)Lastly, the Emilia pizzette had prosciutto cotto, Italian cream, mozz, evoo, parmigiana reggiona, and corn. This was a very savory and creamy pizza. It lacked acids to balance the flavor and had me taking sips of the Moscow mule to cut the richness. (3/5) Although I can't say this place is my definite go to for pizza in the neighborhood, their Vico pizza will have me coming back...for happy hour!	BOQOuwSNhfKx1xvKtONsBg	3	2016-10-30	0	0

The wood-burning oven and wood pile in the dining room gives the whole place a cozy and inviting atmosphere. Our server, Bethany, gave us a nice overview of the menu and explained their style of pizza - Napoleon - and also briefed us on the Happy Hour specials. We were pleased that they had $5 mini-pizzas on the Happy Hour menu since we saw several pizzas (all 12 inches only) on the regular menu that we would like to try. I opted for the Diavola and Hubby got the Emilia with red sauce instead of white. We also ordered a couple of drinks but nothing special. They did seem to have a nice selection of wines and beers and we will definitely explore this next visit when we have more time.The pizzas arrived timely and looked delicious. Like another reviewer stated, the thin crust is crisp on the outside edges but soft in the middle. It almost seems to form a """"bowl"""" as it bakes which causes this. I personally found it to be fine. What I was disappointed with was the taste. Everything was fresh but bland. I had to add salt (which I NEVER do, especially to pizza!) and red pepper flakes to give it flavor. There was certainly nothing """"Devilish"""" about the Diavola!! Hubby enjoyed the Emilia and said next time that he would like to try the Settebello. We will come back when we have more time and try some different menu items for sure!"""

Hence, all orders were limited to their HH menu out of our choice.Pizza Diavola (crushed tomatoes, red bell peppers, spicy salami, garlic, mozzarella, basil and olives) - 3 stars. Pizza Vico (sausage, roasted fennel, mozzarella, basil, olives, red onions) - 3 stars. Crostini con crudo (Prosciutto crudo and shaved parmesan) - 2 stars. Crostata ricotta with nutella- 2 stars. I'm generally a fan of a crisp crust, including the bottom having a slight crisp. The pizza was soggy, a bit too soft for my taste, and basically falling apart as soon as it was picked up. I think this could be a matter of preference, but I thought everything we had was OK.	BOQOuwSNhfKx1xvKtONsBg	3	2015-12-10	3	1

I had read the reviews of my Yelp friends and likes the sound of the Rafael pizza which was on their special of the day and it sounded good.  When I talked to the young man at the podium and told him I wanted to place a To Go order, I told him about the pizza and the reviews.  He told me he'd check and a short time later, he came back and told me they could make it but they didn't have the caramelized onions for it.  I told him to order it anyway.In just a few short minutes, the pizza was brought to me as I waited in their small waiting area.  I brought it home and it was very good.  It was also the perfect size for two people.My preference is still for thick crust, Sicilian style pizza, but I can see that Settebello will be on my rotation list.

4	UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw	x6fRx6IOv1FtwIEdpbtfaQ	I have been a fan of Settebello for years and was excited that they opened another location closer to my side of town. I had the opportunity to have a meal with some fabulous fellow Yelpers last week and we had a five star meal, as expected. Since we had a larger party, we were able to order and share quite a few different pizzas and desserts. We started with Arancini for our appetizer, which was good and opted for five different pizzas, the Margherita DOC, Settebello, Carbonara, Diavola and the special of the day which was a white pizza. My favorites were the Margherita, Settebello and Diavola, although all of them were great. The Diavola had a fantastic spiciness that I couldn't get enough of. The Margherita was simple, but perfectly made and showcased the quality ingredients that they use. The Settebello is the restaurant's namesake and has the perfect combination of flavors, and I can never say no to a pine nut. My least favorite was probably the white pizza, since it had quite a few more onions than I would have liked. It was lacking for me, but my tablemates seemed to love it quite a bit They do have weekly specials, so it's a good idea to check them out on Facebook or sign up online for their newsletter for updates. Luckily, we were able to sample quite a few desserts as well while we were there. The Caramel Budino stole my heart the moment I read the description on the menu and it did not disappoint. This was one of the highlights of our meal for me. Flavorful and a great combination of flavors. The dessert pizza was heaven. Cinnamon, apples, caramel, powdered sugar served on their beautiful pizza dough. This was a great dessert as well. My second favorite of the day. The S'mores Calzone and Zeppoles didn't do much for me. They were good, but too sweet and chocolatey for my taste. That's probably just me, though. As a fan of Settebello for so long, this meal lived up to all my fond memories of meals with friends at the Settebello in Henderson and makes me wonder why it took me so long between visits.

I had an Old Fashioned which was pretty good and only $5. We ordered a few mini pizzas and an artichoke crostini. The crostini was pretty basic and kinda tasted like artichoke from a can slapped on to some toast with goat cheese.  The mini pizzas were excellent. Perfect char on the crust from the brick oven and the sauces/cheeses were well blended.The service however was lacking. It was apparent the first few minutes of arrival that the staff was struggling with the amount of people in the bar area...we were the bulk of the people in the bar. The waitress took all of our orders but didn't write anything down. Sadly, she had to return to confirm what was ordered but didn't want more than one person talking at a time. She then starting making drinks as well while another person was behind the bar not doing much of anything. Next time, write things down and nudge your co-worker to help you out.

The interior is very beautiful for a pizza place, I like that you can see the pizza oven in the back of the restaurant. When we walked in, there was no one to greet/seat us, even though the restaurant was barely half full. We stood there for a few minutes before a server acknowledged us and yelled to a girl standing by the pizza oven chatting to the cook. That's when I realized she was suppose to be the hostess, but she obviously thought talking to the cook was more important. Moments before, a large group had entered the restaurant and stood behind us, and the hostess ignored me and my friend and immediately spoke to the guy behind me and asked if they had a reservation. Perhaps she thought we were all one party, but I thought that was pretty rude of her not to ask. When we were finally seated, we were unable to get menus right away because they had run out. How do you run out of menus on a Monday night when it's not busy? I'm sure the Office Depot down the street can make color copies at $0.25 each...Aside from that, our pizzas were pretty good. I'm not a big fan of pizzas, but I love the crispiness of the crust and how you can taste the freshness of the ingredients. I had the Vico, which was basically a white pizza with no tomatoes, and it was surprisingly very filling despite it being a very thin-crust pizza.Long story short - good food, subpar service.

We came with a party of 18 and sat in the back private room, which was very nice. The waiter was a little confused and would take a couple orders, then leave, then come back, then give some people pizza before he even finished getting everyone's orders. The food-pizza was gooey and soft in the middle making it hard to pick up (sloppy) and hard to cut (falls apart). I am not sure how you eat this pizza correctly! :)Crust was just right. We had the Setebello pizza and it was good but I would get something else next time. The friends I was with ordered desserts and although I did not try them, they looked amazing!

Sometimes the bartender brings our drinks the moment we sit down because he remembers what we like. The pizza is as authentic Italian as it gets! Thumbs up!  Their gluten free crust is also incredible, you can hardly tell you aren't having the real thing.. Can't go wrong with any of the pizzas, and most of the salads are delicious too! Great selection of and  too.	BOQOuwSNhfKx1xvKtONsBg	5	2017-03-11	1	0

I have been here at least a dozen times since the first time I tried it.  For a pizza place they are a little on the high end, but the atmosphere and product are great.  The lunch special and the happy hour are a great way to try the place on the cheap ($5 for pizza during happy hour).  This is one place that I keep in my restaurant rotation.

Our server bethanie was super nice and was very attentive and knowledgable.The staff were also very polite. The interior of this place was sooo upscale and absolutely beautiful.Their happy hour is incredible. 5$ Moscow mules.... You can steal my money everyday. Their carbonara pizza was sooooo amazing! Me and my BF killed all of it. Their happy hour meat and cheese plate was super good, and their mini pizzas were great! Our bill only came out to 30 something $ which is a steal. I will definitely be coming back and blowing all of my money here! Can't wait to try all of the pizzas!	BOQOuwSNhfKx1xvKtONsBg	5	2015-09-01	5	3

1	90wlZyvIK48a-74fDThhMA	Z0syf5gF6uME6xkpAYdj8A	The food here is good but not great. The pizza is always soggy in the middle, no matter the topping. The outer crust is perfect, chewy and a little dense. I'm flummoxed as to why they use arugula as the only green in their salads.  I have been to Settebello in UT, CA and this location twice. I keep trying to give them another shot but they always fall short. The problem is the service. I have never been asked if I would like dessert or coffee, and I do want both. I am a middle aged average looking Caucasian woman. Usually dining out with the hubby or friends. I like to enjoy my meals out. It is not up to the server to decide that I shouldn't have dessert, and that is what I'm feeling here. Maybe I'm overly sensitive but dinner last night was the last straw. Eric, our waiter, seemed like he couldn't get us out the door fast enough. We had to ask for refills on our drinks and when we did he brought our check. No dessert and no more Settebello. Someone at corporate needs to make sure the wait staff is trained properly.	BOQOuwSNhfKx1xvKtONsBg	3	2015-07-27	1	2

1	_8y-kAoK4BQ_MmzawRpQFw	KfBJDh_rcJ_YMNQeyEZvUQ	Delicious food, flavorful cocktails and a nice happy hour menu but service lacked. We grabbed a couple chairs in the bar area before heading over to see a movie and made it in time for their happy hour which is from 3-6pm. We were a group of 12 women but we came in groups of four with 20 minute increments in between our arrivals. We ordered a few personal pizzas, an artichoke crostini and a couple craft cocktails including a mint Collins, basil gimlet and Moscow mule that were each $5. They have a wide variety on their happy hour menu with lots of different choices. Everything we drank and ate was awesome. The char on the pizza crust that they get from the wood fired oven was perfect. Chewy texture with a little crunch on their crust. The artichoke crostini had slices of prosciutto, large pieces of marinated artichoke and and ricotta. You can't beat the price on the craft cocktails either! Service was incredibly slow, the waitress was overwhelmed when our group came in and never wrote anything down. She would then come back and ask what we ordered every time she took an order. At one point two girls spoke up and she snapped back, you both can't talk to me I can only handle one person at a time. She clearly needed help but no one else came to assist her. Next time write things down. One of my friends waited 20 minutes for a water! Cocktails and food all came at different times even when orders were given to her at the same time. I'm giving it four stars instead of two or three because the food and drinks were good.	BOQOuwSNhfKx1xvKtONsBg	4	2016-02-21	3	4
0	6AbAJalvtI_Lcsy-wSRpGQ	jfirJ0XVGKYhUKx912Yt-A	Been going to both locations for about 10 years. Pizza is excellent. It is 'soggy' in the middle but the crust is chewy, charred, and crispy. It is delicious. My fave is the Settebello without pancetta. Yummy and satisfying. The pancetta makes it too salty and heavy. They also have great cocktails. Usually get the Miguel Douglas. Had the barbershop medicine and it was delicious.	BOQOuwSNhfKx1xvKtONsBg	5	2016-01-12	0	0

We walked in and there was a 10-15 minute wait..no worries! So my family and I went over to the bar to get a drink while we waited. Here's the catch by the time we got our drinks we were already seated. We are talking  20 minutes here...But listen great food amazing atmosphere I always see someone I know when I go and I highly recommend it! It just takes a while to get drink!

1	KfFTGloVpZoOzS9ogf8oWw	WkmApstskEjWIrpOktSSXg	One of my favorite (non Chicago deep dish) pizza spots. The staff here is great. Always friendly and on point. It has a very relaxing and laid back atmosphere, which you notice right when you walk in. The pizza is a traditional Neapolitan style. They have a good variety of pizzas, and have a special pizza of the week. (Which hasn't let me down yet!) There is a very nice bar with a great selection of beers and cocktails. Not to big, but perfect size for a small group to unwind after work. Plus, two happy hours: 3:00p-6:00p and 8:30-to close, Mon-Fri. So if you're looking for a great pizza, friendly staff and a place to relax at an affordable price, try Settebello.	BOQOuwSNhfKx1xvKtONsBg	5	2014-09-23	2	2

Settabello is the place to go to...absolutely where it's at for Napoletana style pizza!IMPORTANT NOTE: If you don't like Napoletana style pizza that is typically eaten with a knife and fork because it is chewy/wet/runny/soggy in the center then don't eat here. It's not their fault if they serve their product correctly. Settebello uses fresh, high-quality ingredients...they cook their pizza in wood burning ovens...they have an approachable wine list with lovely options...they have great salads and desserts to start and finish your meal with! Include a clean, welcoming environment, and Settabello is an easy """"Good as it Gets"""" 5 Stars!My favorite pizzas are the following:Margherita DOCDiavolaPizza CarbonaraSettebelloBiancaI belong to runny egg yolks anonymous due to my addiction/infatuation for the golden spheres of flamboyant goodness that are egg yolks. Settebello does their Pizza Carbonara with a runny yoked egg on top. What's more? You can ask to have a runny egg atop any of their pizzas. I suggest experiencing the Diavola this way...you could also do the Settebello or Bianca this way, but even an addict such as me would leave the Margherita & M. DOC alone.Settebello is easily my vote for best Napoletana pizza in Vegas, but they might be my favorite pizza in Vegas of any style."""	BOQOuwSNhfKx1xvKtONsBg	5	2015-05-16	14	17
32	JQIZhoQB-Tg9hdBEj90m4g	LCY-SUSHqf2Nt0phPGpKfQ	I spy a big pizza pie in your eye!!! (pointing finger)... There being several choices of eateries within Village Square, we happened upon Settebello with front door parking.  It must've been a silent invite.  Good to see it's not crazy busy.  We were seated within a minute of walking in.  Quickly, snapped a photo of the funny happy hour chalkboard.Got seated at a booth and flip page menus were left on the table to view.  So glad it wasn't confusing.  But with all the flavors and ingredients, it took a moment to decide.  Let's just start with ice waters and a pitcher of white sangria.  Perfect pick on the white sangria to bring out our cheerful sides hahaaa.  Wine glasses are $5 during happy hour which is 'til 9pm on Thursdays.  Now we know to order by glass instead of pitcher for happy hour.We tempted our taste buds with artichoke crostini; followed with Settebello pizza.  It was described with Crushed Tomatoes, Pancetta, Wood Oven Sausage, Roasted Mushrooms, Toasted Pine Nuts, Mozzarella, Basil, Extra Virgin Olive Oil.  OMG that was great!  It wasn't so much the thin crust cuz it was soft; usually not my preference.  But if anything has flavor scores, for me I just be quiet and GRUB.  I had no expectations trying this place out, and the food has me starry eyed.  Okay maybe the sangria was a booster.Interior is beautifully designed.  I love the reused wood tables, and the mix of metals and stones.  It's modern but they use a brick oven for their pizzas and you can actually watch them being made.  There's bar stool seating around it for closer observation.  Need to give Matt, our server, applauded acknowledgment for his polite attentive customer service too.  They have a separate bar area where sports fanatics can watch and consume.  The environment overall felt comfortable to chill and relax with the warm colors of the furniture and fixtures.  At the same time Ness and I felt like we were in the spotlight, on our stage.  We were only having a catch up conversation.Recommending Settebello for any reason cuz the food is really flavorful!  Will return to try other pizzas.  Also, cuz their white sangria causes laughter spurts.  And we love to laugh :D	BOQOuwSNhfKx1xvKtONsBg	5	2016-11-03	44	43

We didn't realize they closed at 9 when we went in for dinner at 8:40 p.m. tonight. We were offered food to go and gladly accepted it. There were four of us, my daughter and I split a panzanella salad and a pizza that had jalapeño in the name, I wish I could recall the exact name, it was excellent. It had jalapeño jelly, mozzarella, red onion, an Italian ham and basil. So spicy and delicious! My husband and my son-in-law both loved their pizzas also. We will return when we have time to enjoy the nice atmosphere of the dining room and more of their great customer service.	BOQOuwSNhfKx1xvKtONsBg	5	2017-01-19	1	0

I heard great things about Settebello so that was where we headed. The restaurant has a dim romantic vibe to it, which didn't really suit us that evening since we had our 4 year old. I ordered a caprese salad that was delicious but nothing I couldn't make at home. My bf got us an appetizer to share. It was delicious, but I had recently got my braces put on, so hard crusty bread was not my friend. I had a SMALL bite of it and from what I remember, it was delicious. I believe it had artichoke, prosciutto, and ricotta (?)I forget all the toppings that his pizza included, but I DO remember that the center of each pizza (our son got a regular, kid-sized, cheese pizza) was soggy :( The sauce was delicious but a little too thin. The service was quaint and I remember our waitress mixing the two juices that our son couldn't decide on together, which he thought was pretty neat. I don't know if we'll be back only because we've already got a favorite pizza place, but the experience was nice.	BOQOuwSNhfKx1xvKtONsBg	3	2014-05-25	0	0
3	YLeDSZ1Nh1N0hNsSyQdE3A	95i5cFs2S1iKQGkyZBwNWg	"""Where do I begin? Well how bout I start with I got what I expected. Meaning after reading numerous Yelp reviews about how the pizza is either a hit or a miss because of the wet or uncooked pizza dough. I could see why some people wouldn't care for it. For me I knew it was going to be like that so I guess I wasn't as disappoint as oppose to someone who wasn't expecting soggy center. I came right when they open first customer of the day. The restaurant itself is super cool, very rustic and stylish. Classy with lots and lots of space. The bar to the left is a great size with flat screen TVs. The kitchen is sort of open with an awesome oven for pizza prepping. I also notice a nice size private dinning room which can be closed off to the rest of the Resturant. We were greeted nicely and seated promptly. I started off with the Insalata Grande which was dresses lightly but perfectly with a balsamic vinaigrette. The fresh mixed greens with baby arugula was simply topped with their amazing roasted or more like sautéed mushrooms, delicious salty olives, tomatoes, shaved parmigiana and the best chunks of juicy tender artichoke hearts. But the best part of it was the pine nuts. It gave the salad the crunch it needed. Wife and I shared the Signature Settebello pizza. Waitress kindly described their pizza as being thin crust with chard crust and """"chewy"""" dough meaning it's completely wet in the middle where you can't even pick it up even if you had skills. The pizza came out pretty quick and had lots of flavor the sausage was amazing the chard crust was something I really dig but yes the center was  soggy. There has to be a way for them to make their yummy pizza with a more cooked and not so wet center. You almost have to use a fork to eat it properly without a fork just forget about trying to pick it up. Other then that I really did like what I had, priced fairly but I wasn't blown away to where I will come running back. Very nice Resturant and will return just not any time soon."""

1	HVa84WqQT5Klz4knWtGBqw	jdxiorY3irfNJuHMIg_Prw	This Settebello location is absolutely impressive when it comes to the interior. Maybe it just hit me because it was new and I didn't expect a pizza joint to be so nicely decorated. Would recommend for a nice low-key date night with a movie theater just steps away. Their pizzas  come in one size, which I approximate around 10-12 inches round. Perfect for sharing between two people or feeding a very hungry individual. The Pizza Napoletana dough is softer than your average pizza and is meant to be eaten with a knife and fork. The pizza is cooked in a wood-fired oven and I would liken it to a thicker version of Indian naan bread. Wonderful texture, in my opinion. Ordered the Vico pizza  with sausage, fennel, red onions, mascarpone, mozzarella, and basil. The sausage was nicely seasoned and all the ingredients complemented each other well.I made sure to save room for dessert which I think were called Bombolinis. Bombolinis, beignets, donuts, whatever... I love!	BOQOuwSNhfKx1xvKtONsBg	5	2013-12-27	3	3
2	C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w	KoZa4WhgaAOtJRYcYLFG-A	Settebello, you let me down! There was one item that I had every intention of ordering and it wasn't there. That item was a budino, an Italian pudding-like dessert. It's simple, but when done right it'll make you wonder why you haven't had it sooner.Of course, Settebello is know for their pizza rather than desserts so I had to try one. I opted for the self-titled pie the Settebello ($13.50) with crushed tomatoes, pancetta, wood oven sausage, roasted mushrooms, pine nuts, mozzarella, basil, and evoo. The interplay of savoriness and saltiness made for excellent flavors and the pine nuts added a crunchy texture that elevated the rest of the dish. My biggest complaint was the paper thin crust under the pie. I understand the Napoli-style makes for a wet pizza with a soft, pliable crust, but the lack of density beneath all the ingredients made it appear soupy. A good pizza for sure, but my personal preference is for a firmer crust.Without the budino, I decided to try two desserts. First up was the Dream Bomba ($5), a dense ball of caramel surrounded by a creamy and smooth peanut butter gelato and coated in chocolate. It was cut into four wedges. A solid dessert for sure, and one that you'll want to share.The second almost made me forget why I came here in the first place. The zeppole ($5.50) were soft, warm pillowy mini doughnuts of deliciousness filled with plenty of nutella. Coated with plenty of sugar, it's a sure-fire cure for any sweet tooth. If you're sharing with a kid, like I was, make sure you get extra napkins because most of the sugar and nutella ended up all over his face.While not quite living up to the lofty expectations I had, Settebello is a great family-friendly dining option, especially if you're craving pizza Napoletana.

Located in the Village Square shopping center right by the movie theater, there is tons of parking so its very convenient. We have tried various items here but our favorites have been their Italian Panini (not on the menu but ask your server/bartender about it) Its huge so I suggest sharing it! Also when were in the mood for pizza we get the Diavola, Crushed Tomatoes, Finnochiona (Peppered Salame), Roasted Red Bell Peppers, Crushed Red Peppers, Garlic, Mozzarella, Extra Virgin Olive Oil. AMAZING! it has a kick so its not for those who dont like spice.Josh the GM is great. He makes our dining exp so much more enjoyable then anywhere else we frequent.

They've had some great special pizzas of the week but their Margherita DOC is always the best. Besides pizza, the rest of their food is good to average- the pizza outshines the rest of the menu for me. The bar and cocktails are well above average. The wine list is good.

3	Gr-MqCunME2K_KmsAwjpTA	t-G0EUb-Fl2fqu5ZM0PclA	This is really REALLY good pizza!  It is different in that it is more European and rustic than the typical American sliced pizza.  The crust is different too.  It is really fluffy in the edges and the inside is really thin.  This makes eating it a little messy but totally worth it.  Their pizza is traditionally served unsliced and you eat it by tearing off little bits.  Good fun if you are having your own pizza.  If you are sharing or don't want to be a mess they will slice them up for you!Here are some of the pizzas that I have tried so far:1) Settebello: This is the name of the restaurant, how can you go wrong?  It has crushed tomatoes, pancetta, sausage, mushroom, pine nuts, mozzarella, basil, and olive oil.  It is like an everything pizza.  So good.  If I had to choose one to be my favorite, this would be it.2) Pizza Carbonara: Crushed tomatoes, pancetta, eggs, mozarella, pepper, olive oil.  The eggs are mixed in with the chesse.  This is another tomato sauce pizza that is really good.3) Emilia (white pizza): Prosciutto, panna (cream), mozzarella, parmigiono reggiano, basil, olive oil.  Excellent and tasty white pizza.  The creamy consistency is delicious.4) Vico (white pizza): Sausage, fennel, red onions, mascarpone, mozzarella, basil, olive oil.  The sausage and red onions on this pizza are delicious.Basically all the pizzas are really good.  The bruschetta is good too but needed a little salt in my opinion.  For dessert the Bella Mella: apple with caramel, vanilla mascarpone, and almonds was the best.  We tried the nutella pizza (so-so) and the nutella filled donuts.  The apple pie was the best by far.Come here for some great pizza and a food coma shortly to follow.  I fell asleep right after and didn't wake up to brush my teeth or shower until 6am.  It is powerful pizza.	BOQOuwSNhfKx1xvKtONsBg	5	2014-01-06	4	4

The Napoletana style Pizza is thin crust but really nice and moist comes out steaming. We love the Diavolo which is the peppered salami. There's also a nice but small selection of wine and beer.

0	rv6X1P5gvYFULMAfYALQ_A	mJi3PXiYMVprfWWgl9yFRg	We went to this restaurant a while back and I have to say this place is a huge disappointment, when we went and we were seated at a table that was in a corner we were with our three kids my wife and my mother and the table was too small it also slid all over the concrete floor which suckedThey notified us upon being seated that their credit card machine wasn't going to work which just created a lot of hassle and inconvenience I ordered my pizza without any artichoke hearts and of course when it arrived it had artichoke hearts I didn't bother sending it back because it wasn't even worth doing, the other issue was that they don't give you any fair warning about the pepperoni that they use on their pizza for kids pepperoni that pepperoni was really spicy and the kids wouldn't eat it .  They should say something and tell you that before you order it.  The food is overpriced for what you get and the ingredients themselves including the crust and everything else is just a low quality compared to other restaurants that occupy this sort of sector / case in point would be due forni which smokes this place, you shouldn't even bother to go here,  worth it and I'll never come here again while duo forni is open, don't be fooled	BOQOuwSNhfKx1xvKtONsBg	2	2014-05-25	0	0

It lacked flavor is the best way to put it. The only flavor that stood out was that of burning fire, like a marshmallow without the deliciousness of a mallow. I also enjoy my pizza crust crisp or at least the opposite of soggy. However, that's this style of pizza-- doughy in the center. I won't be returning and not because of the service. The pizza was really that uneventful.	BOQOuwSNhfKx1xvKtONsBg	2	2015-10-30	1	0

When we went it happened to be happy hour, and most food and beverage items on the happy hour menu were $5. So we ordered 3 mini pizzas, and a fritta (fried calzone), and 2 beers. The pizzas were very good, we got the diavola, the vico and the margherita. I didn't love the fritta, and would have preferred a normal calzone, but my brother really liked the texture of the fried calzone dough and thought it was unique. In short, I would go back again for the great happy hour deals.	BOQOuwSNhfKx1xvKtONsBg	4	2016-10-15	0	0
7	_pE9wtP4DhTxlPw_fbwrlQ	AUVXSYSEEvZURjPLHhBB3g	We are absolutely furious with the pizza makers. They burnt all 4 pizzas which is absolutely ridiculous. ONLY GO WHEN AUGUSTINE IS WORKING ALONE. The cooks other than Augustine have burnt every single pizza that I have seen come out of the oven. I saw the two cooks and they both were not paying attention and we're talking to each other while the pizza was cooking. Whether the oven is hot or not, they both burned all of the pizzas that came out of the oven. I would rather pay double for Augustine to make and cook the pizza because he doesn't burn it first of all and the flavor is more deep and the mozzarella is perfectly melted. I feel like I wasted my money and time today because I cannot even eat the crust or the bottom of the pizza because it was all completely soggy and burned. Like what I am left with to eat... The toppings?! I think Augustine should be the main chef at Settebello because he is consistently making perfect pizzas which is the only reason why we go there and gave 5 stars in the past. I will not be going there anymore except on Sunday's when Augustine works there and the two other cooks are not. My point is why should I pay $45 for a couple burned pizzas? Also, I usually don't like to write bad reviews, like last time I was there, there was strand of blonde hair and well what do you know... the pizza was burnt. And of course Augustine was not the cook. If you like burned pizzas this is the place for you.	BOQOuwSNhfKx1xvKtONsBg	1	2015-02-27	13	7

He was knowledgeable and passionate, and we thoroughly enjoyed our evening.For starters my husband and I had a platter with toasted bread, prosciutto, mozzarella buffalo, and tomatoes in basil. We topped one topping on the next, and it was to die for. It wasn't even on the menu, so I can't remember what it is called!My husband had an Old Fashioned and he said it was the best one of his life.Next, we both dove into some pies. My husband got the diavvolo (spelling?) and I got a pizza with artichoke hearts, kalamata olives, and salami. Both pizzas were incredible, but my husband's was spicier and more full of flavor. The crust is thin, doughy in the center, and the crust dipped into the red pepper olive oil is the best thing in the whole world.For dessert, I had the traditional tiramisu, and my husband tried the strawberry and crema dessert. Both were heavenly. We asked Josh throughout the meal to pair up our food with adult beverages, and each time he was spot on.We cannot wait to go back! The best pizza in town. In fact, my husband said the pizza was better than when he was in Italy.Well done, Settebello!	BOQOuwSNhfKx1xvKtONsBg	5	2015-05-26	0	0
0	JN-F23BIngBKd9MSaXoI8w	tvMEXqzJ1OxHyMRGdGx5VA	I have come here plenty of times, so I figured it was time to give it a review.Ever since I stumbled on this place, I have always enjoyed each subsequent visit. They serve  Neapolitan pizzas that originates from Italy instead of the more traditional American versions like thin crust New York Style, Chicago deep dish, fancy California pizzas, etc.They have a varied menu of appetizers, salads, pizzas, and desserts, so there are plenty of options for anyone to find something to suit their tastes. I normally tend to get their margherita, crushed tomatoes, cheese, olive oil, basil, and  parmigiano reggiano, and their Settebello, a pizza similar to the margherita but with sausage, pancetta and mushrooms. I am always looking for a good cannoli and the one that they serve here is exceptional, especially coming from a pizza place.As I am regularly pleased with their food and service, my only complaint is that the bottoms of their pizzas can be soggy and limp at times. Even when it does happen, which isn't often, the pizza still tastes awesome.If you are a fan of pizza, and are looking for something different than your regular New York style or Chicago style joint, this would be a good addition to your pizza rotation.

Featuring all the standards of a certified parlor, inclusive of a hand pressed di Sorrento brick oven, all wood firing, and imported flour worked by hand it was perhaps with a bit of gluttony that a the decision was made to sample four of the restaurant's four signature pies plus the weekly special but in the end each and every one was an individually shaped, lightly charred, bubbly and balanced success.  Truly a space where the concept of quality ingredients and time honored techniques yield a superior product it was with two golden, creamy arancini that the meal began and then progressing through pizza both red and white, simple and complex it was perhaps most telling that the best slices of the day belonged to the Margherita DOC with a the Buffala Mozz briny funk finding harmony in the hand crushed tomatoes yet not to be outdone the eponymous Settebello also shined as the novel pine nuts and mushrooms added an earthen undertone to the pairing of cured meats.  Truly a place where not a single savory was anything less than excellent it was without hesitation that desserts were selected and again choosing broadly the rewards were myriad; a creamy budino on par with DOCG's for best in town a clear favorite amongst many while the Bella Mela proved just as well conceptualized as the pizzas though ever more subtle - a characteristic ignored by both the Calzone and Zeppole; the first harkening a campfire's smoke and the second soft and supple but both filled to bursting chocolate decadence and all the better for it."""

I thought their Henderson location was the best pizza I'd had in LV so that's what I expected.  It wasn't the same but it was still pretty good.Let's start off with the restaurant itself.  The place is big compared to the original and they did an awesome job with the decor, open kitchen and cool bar area.  I look forward to coming back for happy hour multiple times.  $5 mini pizzas among other food deals from 3pm-6pm ensures that.  So my wife and I split the """"Panzanella"""" salad (House Made Croutons, Cherry Tomato, Prosciutto Crisps, Red Onion, Fennel, Cucumber, Basil, Arugula, Shaved Parmigiano Reggiano, Red Wine Vinaigrette) which was good as usual.  I really like the prosciutto crisps since they're basically super bacon bits and could've used more of them but no biggie.   Then the pizzas came out.  My wife got the Margherita DOC which was topped with fresh buffalo mozzarella as opposed to the regular cheese and well worth the $1-$2 upgrade.  I usually get the Settebello pizza (Crushed Tomatoes, Pancetta, Wood Oven Sausage, Roasted Mushrooms, Toasted Pine Nuts, Mozzarella, Basil, Extra Virgin Olive Oil) but chose to get the Pizza Carbonara instead.  I should've stuck with the Settebello.  Why mess with perfection?  Pancetta, egg, mozzarella and crushed tomatoes just sounded so good but it didn't come together as well as I was hoping.Funnily enough, when the waiter came to ask how everything was and we gave our obligatory """"fine"""", he just comes out of nowhere and says """"Yeah.  I am kinda conflicted on the carbonara...."""" and just walks away.  Hmmmmm.  Not enough pancetta or sauce and the crust wasn't as well done as I wanted it to be.  But after all, it was still pizza and it was good but not the best.  My wife's margherita was great.  I still have a lot of love for Settebello and look forward to bumping it up to 5 stars."""

0	tnSVm_tdM5zthKgmGF5d1A	BdQMn626u-N_rIhWvkinWA	Came here on a Thursday night with a group of 10 people. We started off with drinks at the bar as we waited for everyone to get there. The bar service was slow...really slow. I do hate to bash bar service, because it's quite often a staffing problem, not a speed problem with the bartender. I waited 15 minutes to get my first drink, which my friend ordered for me before I even got there. The poor bartender was crazy busy until another bartender finally joined her. They were both super friendly. My guess is, they usually staff more bartenders earlier on in the nights for Fri, Sat, Sun.When we were ready for food, they smartly moved us into a private dining area with glass doors. This was a wise decision on their part. This IS a family establishment as well, and some in our group were getting a tad rowdy. Good to move to keep everyone happy. The pizza was phenomenal. We ordered the gluten free crust and it was, hands down, the best gluten free crust I have had. I actually was super skeptical it was even gluten free, so I had to ask what was in it. We did have a little mix up with the bills at the end due to our switching from the bar to the dining area. All in all, great time here. Props to the staff here for letting us ourselves while maintaining a family atmosphere for the rest of the customers.	BOQOuwSNhfKx1xvKtONsBg	4	2014-11-01	2	1

It was pretty quiet during a weekday, but there were a few people coming in to pick up their phone orders. Our server was very nice. We mentioned that it was our first time there and he explained the menu to us in detail, as well as what pizzas from Napoli were all about. We decided to share one pizza, but couldn't decide what to order. In my opinion, I feel like it's a bad sign when the menu is complicated and when I don't see anything appealing. Thankfully, our server tried his best to help us out. He asked us what kind of pizza we were looking for, and we replied, """"something with meat."""" I can't remember the name of the pizza (nor do I see it on their online menu), but he did suggest a cheese pizza made with meat sauce. He said that they don't have traditional pizzas like pepperoni or sausage. So we just went with his suggestion. We also ordered a salad and I believe it was called the Insalata. It was the simplest sounding one on the menu.I must admit I am picky about my salads. The leafy greens that are used need to be dark green and fresh! Not light green with brown on the sides. That being said, they did use good quality greens! However, I didn't really like the vinaigrette on the salad, it tasted quite bland. I prefer my dressing to have at least some taste. Unfortunately, I wasn't impressed with the pizza either. Yes, the ingredients were fresh and hot, but the pizza was hard to eat. The main problem was that the crust was very thin and with every bite, the ingredients would just fall off. Kind of felt like I was just eating crust most of the time and it was pretty messy. Thankfully, ordering dessert was a great idea. The Tiramisu was delicious and not too sweet. The coffee flavor wasn't overpowering (or lacking) like how it was at other restaurants. I thought it was funny how they put """"contains raw egg"""" in the description on the dessert menu. When we asked our server about that, he said """"Well, it starts off with raw egg, then it gets mixed with...."""" Umm ok, so that means a lot of dishes start off with raw egg, right??Anyway, now I can say I finally tried it, but was not impressed. Fancy pizzas are definitely not for me. I will happily stick to my boring Pepperoni Pizzas, thank you very much!"""	BOQOuwSNhfKx1xvKtONsBg	3	2014-07-02	2	2

However the place looks like a really cool spot to be in once the sun goes down and more people start to come through.  The decor is very rustic which is nice and you can see the huge pizza over in the back of the restaurant.FOOD:  The pizzas here are meant to be eaten individually (no large pizzas to be shared) and I'm not so sure if I'm a fan of this style.  I enjoy having a huge pizza in front of everyone and everyone getting a slice.  Regardless, these are Neapolitan style pizzas which have a much chewier center while the outsides are crisp.  It had a little too much chew for my liking, but what made the pizza great was the freshness of the ingredients.  I had the Capricciosa pizza and it was a great choice overall.  SERVICE:  Our server was nice enough to explain how Neapolitan pizza differs from other types and did a good job in explaining their options on the menu.  It was a well run service, nothing truly remarkable but certainly beats many other restaurants I've been to where the service truly lacked.	BOQOuwSNhfKx1xvKtONsBg	4	2014-09-25	1	0

If people are complaining, they are not used to the real thing and need a trip to Italy to explore another part of the world. This restaurant is certified as well. The ambiance was lovely, modern with a warm, comfortable twist. Though the layout is quite open, it was still quiet enough to hear the person seated across from you. This restaurant could easily accommodate a group of 8 -10 for lunch/dinner. My friend dined here for a late lunch the week before, and he said their Happy Hour prices and specials were surprisingly decent. I will give it a try in the next few weeks. The server was amazing - attentive, knowledgeable,  friendly, and inviting. As many of us know, great servers are a rare breed now-a-days in LV as most act like they are doing their guests a favor in the land of Make a Living Off Your Tips. This was also nice to find at a new, trendy, hotspot in Vegas. (Server was Josh - he remembered my guy friend's name and is unfortunately going to the Henderson location permanently). The timing of the food was perfect, the quality was great, and the price was reasonable. Everything I tasted was delicious - not too much, not bland, and authentic.

Salame plate was excellent.  Service was mediocrity at best.  Felt rushed out door.  No offer for dessert or coffee.  Oh well.  Won't be back.	BOQOuwSNhfKx1xvKtONsBg	3	2015-07-26	2	1
0	dkwVTiFDVIwTJplmw7wwdw	ivJgFbw0rgnItbv7kmbkVw	This place had such potential. Good location. Nice ambiance. But we have had a couple of bad experiences now and won't be going back. 1. There is no pepperoni.2. Their salads taste like a pine tree and not in a good way. 3. The service was really slow. We finally got out of there after 2 1/2 hours. We went on a weekend night and there were only a few other people dining, but we were not attended to very well. There were multiple waiters but refills were neglected. 4. The pizza just wasn't that great. Project pie, Grimaldis, biaggios, and other pizza places in Vegas are a lot better. 5. The waiter had a difficult time splitting the checks. 6. We both got sick from what we ate and had stomach issues all night. TMIWe will not be going back. But in all fairness, if you still want to try it, at least they have coke products and their bathrooms are nice.	BOQOuwSNhfKx1xvKtONsBg	1	2014-07-27	0	0

0	AvK98KWExan0cJDCENZKzA	KE-h-_KJq5Fe1qSERHzFqA	The pizza at Settebello is amazing and there are so many unique toppings to choose from.  Settebello offers pizza and salads (and a full bar) but this is an amazing Italian atmosphere to relax and enjoy great food and service!	BOQOuwSNhfKx1xvKtONsBg	5	2016-01-11	0	0
0	54zqyneshZvyWymZLE6mJw	acUxOpK_6U_syVsMpBmG2A	This is a beautiful place, the service was friendly, attentive, and as far as I'm concerned can't be improved on.We stopped in for some pizzas and I just wasn't impressed.  We got a carbonarra which had 4 slices if pancetta and maybe 3 small leaves if basil on it, not enough for me.  The eggs are scrambled which really killed it for me.  The cheese was just a little light but not a problem.  We also had the mageritta DOC and 5 slivers of cheese is not enough for me on that either.  I like these pizzas a little thicker and more sauce so you can scoop it all up with the crust.  The dough was tasty and cooked very well.  Prices are right about par for a place like this.  I've had better wood fired pizza here locally and I do not go to pizza house for the decor.	BOQOuwSNhfKx1xvKtONsBg	3	2013-10-31	1	0

We got a couple different pizzas and both were really nice. The prices weren't outrageous either. Great place to stop before or after a movie!	BOQOuwSNhfKx1xvKtONsBg	5	2015-10-22	1	1

According to their menu, their pizza is freshly hand crafted cooked in a 900 degree wood burner for about a minute. I ordered the original margarita pizza. It's a pretty decent size for 1 or 2 people. The dough was very thin and soft and the blend of their crushed tomatoes, mozzarella, parmigiana, basil and olio was beautifully tasted amazing. I really liked the atmosphere and their huge wooden tables. The lighting felt perfect for the dinner setting and it was not too dark or too bright. The service was exceptional but very slow at refilling drinks. Overall I've enjoyed this pizzeria and would come back again. Thank you!	BOQOuwSNhfKx1xvKtONsBg	4	2016-05-06	0	0

Great waitress...really nice and seemed to enjoy her job.  We ordered the warm beet salad and three pizzas.  I had the Rafael....out of this world...best pizza I have ever had in this town.   My friends were happy with their pizzas too. There were lots of families...and kids...so it's not a quiet place.  Great food and great prices.  Very fair.  Loved the atmosphere too.

He melts at this joint.  I melt for the cocktails.  Strip mall location, so meh there, but damn good.	BOQOuwSNhfKx1xvKtONsBg	4	2013-12-13	0	2
0	TLd8uhbsJOZt591Mh-P6Yg	v4JU7str1Grl8ii0EIbjLA	This is the best pizza in Las Vegas. The Diavola pizza I believe is my favorite of all time. The Margherita DOC is also delicious with the creamy buffalo mozarella. I have to have it at least once a week. The Panzanella salad goes good on top of the pizza. I was never a fan of fennel until the I tried the salad. The service is great. The food rivals Napoli's best pizza. If you're looking for authentic Neapolitan pizza you have to try this. Writing this review is making me hungry!	BOQOuwSNhfKx1xvKtONsBg	5	2016-05-16	0	0

All I wanted to do was pick up my takeout; 2 pies and a salad. I gave my card to one girl who stood with my credit card 5 feet away from me complaining to another employee about a previous customer for 3 minutes while I watched her not running my card and not getting my food. After finally handing over my food, I was asked if I wanted parmesan cheese and red peppers. You could have asked this before you went to get the food so you could have grabbed everything at once making my wait less but yes I do. Hot damn! Apparently those toppings are in short supply because I was given two packets of peppers and 1 ramekin of cheese that was so empty I could count the flakes. $39 bucks and I can't even have half a ramekin?Okay, well the front of house sucked but how about those delicious pies I've been reading about?I got home with our pizzas and salad and without saying a word to my wife she took a bite and said, """"these aren't cooked all the way."""" Sure weren't. I knew this because I had to sneak a piece on the way home (to test things out as any good husband would do) and had the luxury of eating cheese that wasn't quite melted. On to the """"bread"""" salad. There were two croutons in it. It was a sea of arugula. Back of house fail. Not sure what is going on with this place. It has all the elements of a good restaurant but the execution is way off. Whoever owns this place needs to step in quickly because the staff are not trained well and it shows. With so many pizza options, don't waste your time or money here."""	BOQOuwSNhfKx1xvKtONsBg	1	2014-03-08	2	1
0	AVQJ6tJp-o-p9gxpw1hkdA	DYdR4-20YpRzDXygcXaD-A	This quite possibly was the worst pizza I ever had. I cannot wrap my head around how this place has such good reviews. I ordered the bolognese pizza and the settebello. Took 40min to get pizza first off. The bolognese was disgusting. It was like eating soup pizza. Was basically raw dough in the middle. I had one slice of the bolognese and was done. The settebello was raw in the middle as well but not as bad as the bolognese. The waitress said the pizza was soft but I was not expecting raw pizza. Just a horrible texture. Bring your spoon to eat your pizza at this place.	BOQOuwSNhfKx1xvKtONsBg	1	2013-12-16	2	0

Ordered traditional cheese pizza and meatballs! Everything was yammi, yammi. Pizza barely has a crust at all, so thin and those burnt crispy edges...mmmm! Meatballs were so soft and came with 2 slices of bread sprinkled with olive oil. Very happy with our lunch!	BOQOuwSNhfKx1xvKtONsBg	5	2017-04-23	1	1
0	4rz5b_uogU5Svs9_IYNVTQ	YBNVORdK6-i4JMKvkh9_GQ	This place is literally the best pizza joint in town. They are very traditional in their preparation and presentation. They import a lot of ingredients, and even some of their equipment directly from Italy. I eat here constantly, try the 'Misto', best appetizer ever!!	BOQOuwSNhfKx1xvKtONsBg	5	2013-10-22	1	0

0	2Xv3RPbhSpiI-LTQ8lmZfw	7-D4K1G65XccsJdf3hfchw	Yum! We tried This place out because of all the other good restaurants around it. It lives up to the standard set by the other nearby places. The service was great, attentive, helpful, and quick. The specialty drink menu also has a delicious Moscow mule on it. Now, let's talk about the pizza. It's very good. I love the brick oven style and this is one of the better versions of it I've had. We had the Margarita pizza and it was great. The crust is chewy and the toppings were really fresh. Can't wait to try something else off the menu next time.	BOQOuwSNhfKx1xvKtONsBg	4	2014-06-13	0	0
