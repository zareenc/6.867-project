2	yOM891kAdwni5ecnGsQcWw	O8pP_jNkIBtChBkNRn6STg	I really like this little place.  :)The food is very good, and I've never had a bad meal here.  Salads, calamari, red sauce, pastas, bread, olive oil...all very, very good.  Dessert was kinda meh (though I ate it anyway - it's rude to wrap with Italians), but they have a decent wine list, so eat up, and skip dessert.98% of the all-male staff are exceptionally hot, btw (there might have been women working there, but I didn't notice in the sea of tall, dark and handsome and dressed in black).  Playing for both teams, and perhaps even bridging some gaps, there is plenty of eye candy and flirt-worthy boys for everyone.  I was tempted to write my number on a few bev naps and pass them around to anyone who eye fucked me longer than 10 seconds.  I'd recommend not taking a date you're pretty into just for this reason (lesson learned - lol).	a11zyJN_ue0CQ_bjoeke-w	4	2012-07-24	0	0

The food and service were amazing, despite the challenges of feeding 75 people all at once.  Servers got us our drinks quickly, refilled our water glasses often, and kept those huge yummy rolls coming!  We ate family style (ordering 4 big dishes to be shared), and yet the kitchen was able to accommodate a few of us who had dietary restrictions (vegetarian, gluten-free).  The salad was a healthy prelude to all the fantastic food to come!  The penne vodka was the best i've ever had - the pasta was pleasantly al dente and the vodka sauce has a nice mix of flavors (slightly tangy, slightly sweet, slightly peppery).  The meat-eaters at the table were equally ranting and raving about the veal shiitake (in a marsala sauce) and the chicken martini (in a white wine sauce).  Can't wait to go back the next time we're in Phoenix!!	a11zyJN_ue0CQ_bjoeke-w	5	2016-05-17	0	0

My daughter wasn't feeling well so we ordered soup it took them 45 minutes before they even realized she was never given the soup, I had to ask for it. We didn't get out of there until a quarter after eight we had to wait an hour and 15 minutes for our food. A party of eight came in after us and left 25 minutes before us. Not too happy with them. Not like they used to be.	a11zyJN_ue0CQ_bjoeke-w	2	2016-02-26	1	0

I live 2 min form this restaurant so I got it delivered to my house. Well, how to say it? It has to be the worse pasta I've ever had. So much cream I couldn't even find the pasta in the plate, there is no flavor whatsoever. I felt like the opened a can of tomato sauce, added some cream and pepper to eat and bye bye. Seriously guys.!!Same for the bread, It was plain and not so good. I know some of you might think that because it got delivered, this is the reason why it was bad. But no, everything was very hot when it got here. The only good thing was the can of coke!	a11zyJN_ue0CQ_bjoeke-w	2	2017-01-22	0	0

Ruins the meal. The Penne vodka sauce was good with over cooked, I imagine precooked and reheated pasta. I added chicken; that should have been grilled and seasoned, but was no doubt boiled with no flavor whatsoever. I did not even eat it for the extra 3 bucks.  If you bring bread to the table, bring butter, but not butter that is so hard you can't even get it on the bread. Pasta Brioni is saved by the ambiance.	a11zyJN_ue0CQ_bjoeke-w	2	2016-05-01	0	0

We both ordered their cheese ravioli and after the first bite we both determined that it had been cooked in the same water that had had some type of seadfood cooked in it.  The taste of shellfish was very evident.  Also, their bruschetta was not good at all. I would not recommend the restaurant.	a11zyJN_ue0CQ_bjoeke-w	1	2012-11-14	1	0

The Bad - My biggest disappointments were, number one, all the glasses on the table for 4, both water and wine, were horribly water spotted. I've never seen such a thing in a restaurant. Number two, my husband had a soft drink and asked for a refill. He was charged for 2 soft drinks. Who charges for refills these days??

I've ordered their pizza before and love it - they are also one of the few places that have kalamata olives! Delivery charge is $1, unlike many of the chain places around that charge quite a bit more. I've always had really great service. If there is something up they've always called me right away and I've yet to meet one of their delivery folks I haven't really liked. Today they did especially well, were especially fast and helped me get my cat back inside :)	a11zyJN_ue0CQ_bjoeke-w	5	2015-03-08	0	0
2	XrsyfOHI940MroW6MFoJIw	Ne6ZXFrJAJZ9emI_ppLrbQ	I like Brioni's.  The Happy Hour specials are a steal.  The ambiance is usually very good.  I like the old school formal wooden decor.  The food is anywhere from good to outstanding depending on the item.  In general, they follow the Italian tradition of choosing the best ingredients, instead of gimmicky crap.I really like the mussels with the marachiara sauce.  That (clear tomato with garlic) sauce is worth a trip.  The calamari salad is also a wonderful and healthy choice.  Split that with a friend at happy hour followed by a pasta dish and you're eating like a king for nothin'.  I've had 4 or 5 pasta dishes that were all great.  Today, I had the chicken sorrentino which was very good.However, I did have one bad experience that I'd like to share for the purpose of entertaining Yelpers and perhaps fixing the issue at a restaurant I enjoy eating at.If you're about to eat, you might want to stop reading.  - I ordered my food.  It was a later in the lunch hour and pretty empty.- I went to the bathroom.- After going, I saw there was NO toilet paper.  This is pretty bad for an upscale restaurant, but whatever.  Call it an oversight.- So, I called the restaurant from my cell phone and explained that I was in the bathroom in need of toilet paper.- No one ever came.  I gave up because I was in a hurry during the work day.- After eating, I checked the bathroom again.  Still, no toilet paper.I know this is a weird situation and I've eaten here about six times with no similar issues.  I was too bashful to bring it up again in person and there was no feedback link on their web site.  So, I'm hoping someone will read this review at the restaurant and fix the issue so that it does not happen again.	a11zyJN_ue0CQ_bjoeke-w	4	2011-03-05	1	0

If you like 'em tall (or short), dark, handsome and sarcastic, you'll love Pasta Brioni.The servers even have their own calendar.  Wait.  Is this the male version of Hooters?  This is a great place to come with the girls for birthday parties, bachelorette parties or 'just because.'  The servers are very attentive- perhaps a little overly- (are lap dances always included with your meal)?? The servers aren't the only good part of this restaurant though.  The food is delicious.  The pasta's are all great- the ravioli, pasta giardini, lasagne- you can't really go wrong.So grab some girls, order a carafe or two of sangria and enjoy the scenery along with a great meal!	a11zyJN_ue0CQ_bjoeke-w	4	2007-06-19	6	5

It seems no one there knows how to smile or make a guest feel welcome. I had made on line reservations 5 days prior to our visit on 4/27. we arrived a few minutes before our 7 PM reservation by a very disinterested host/manager who offered no greeting other than """"please follow me"""". At this time he proceeded to lead us to the outside patio, it was in the mid 90's that day and I had no desire to sit outside. When  I advised him that I would prefer to sit in one of the two open tables in the main dinning room his only comment other than let me check was that there was no preference on my reservation to which I replied that most restaurants ASK if we would like outside dinning.I followed him back to the host stand where after a moment he said OK take the table in the dinning room,  he made no effort to escort us there and an attitude was clearly shown. It took  a waiter a good 5 minutes to greet us at the table and apologize for being behind and that he would return shortly. From here on the service was painfully slow and other than at the end the server finally said he was sorry that the kitchen was backed up. Mr. Personality that originally sat us was positioned but a few feet from our table the entire meal never did stop by and say hello or say that he was sorry for any seating issues that we incurred.By the way, the food was just OK, not worth the 25 minute trip when I have Maggiano's, Carrabba's and Nicks all within two miles of my home. NO one at Pasta Brioni's even tried to make me feel like I was a valued guest. I prefer to spend my $$$$ where my presence is appreciated.JC"""	a11zyJN_ue0CQ_bjoeke-w	2	2013-04-28	1	0

It has been in the Valley FOREVER and most often my family gets takeout but I have to say, dining in is a super fab experience. They bring you warm, doughy rolls to start that are absolutely delicious. The best part, they have EVOO + Balsamic on the tables so that you can dip your bread! {my guilty pleasure} We split a bottle of delicious Chianti and then for my meal, I ordered a garden salad with their homemade Italian dressing {so yum!} and the piccata but subbed chicken for veal. It was SO tasty. I got it with a side of spaghetti that was just pretty average, I thought the noodles were a tad overdone but that is my only sorta complaint. All in all, I left SO full and ready for bed! Did someone say food coma? I would totally recommend Pasta Brioni for a family dinner, birthday, catering, you name it! They are also known for their cute Italian servers! ;)	a11zyJN_ue0CQ_bjoeke-w	4	2017-03-17	12	13

Bartender was super friendly and service was good. We ordered a ton of food and had quite a bit in front of us. A closed bottle of olive oil fell over the front of the bar.  A greasy rude dude that worked there picked it up and made some comment about how EXPENSIVE it was and how that was the last bottle until the delivery tomo. Really!!! An italian restaurant and I potentially spilled the last bottle of Olive oil in the entire place and may have put them line down for the night....Keep up the customer service buddy!	a11zyJN_ue0CQ_bjoeke-w	3	2012-05-22	2	0
0	rcTn6KPGYLsG8D8-_4MDNQ	2mJmGgpQ3xkvOnDLa8d1pQ	A few friends and I had a reservation at 7:30 last Saturday at Pasta Brioni. The restaurant was busy - it seems like a popular spot for snowbirds.  Even though we had a reservation, we weren't sat at a table until 7:45. At this point, we realized how disorganized the staff was - we had random mis-matched silverwear (at a table with four of us, it took them 10 minutes and 3 tries to get an almost complete set of silverwear - meaning a fork, a knife, a spoon and a side plate - for everyone at the table.) We also didn't get a menu for almost 15 minutes. Definitely some issues with the service. Although we sat at 7:45, our server didn't take our order until 8:15. It took almost 20 minutes for our appetizer salads to arrive, around 8:35. After we finished our salads, it was another 30 minutes before we had our main courses - they didn't arrive until after 9:10. At this point we were starving, the server tried to make light of the situation - apologizing for the delay and joking that he bet we had time to work up an appetite. The food was very mediocre - not terrible, but nothing special. In my opinion, definitely not worth the hour wait. They also didn't get all of our orders right - my friend had ordered a pasta dish with chicken, only to have it come out without chicken. Another friend was very disappointed with her meal and barely touched it, she didn't complain but I was surprised they didn't offer to bring her something else or take it off the bill. We were all laughing about what a disappointing 2-hour experience it was from start to finish - we won't be back!	a11zyJN_ue0CQ_bjoeke-w	2	2014-01-22	3	0

Quite a bit higher than we had expected, but we were hungry, so we ate.The eggplant rollatini was to die for.  My partner said it was almost as good as her grandmother's, and that is saying A LOT. We decided to split the pumpkin ravioli, and although the addition of fresh corn was a little odd, it was really delicious, and one plate was the perfect portion for two; better yet, they split it for us in the kitchen, making it easier.The servers were quick about our iced tea refills, and one of them chatted up my partner as they were both from New York.I'm giving 4 stars (instead of 5) for the price being a bit high, and the oddness of having sports play while eating $14 ravioli.	a11zyJN_ue0CQ_bjoeke-w	4	2010-05-04	2	2

This wasn't the case for Pasta Brioni. I've been avoiding going because I tend to trust Yelpers but I was honestly pleasantly surprised. I went for a friends birthday and there were three of us. I tend to stay away from """"suggestions"""" or """"specials"""" bu the waiter did a great job of going over them and not being pushy. To start with the negatives, I'd say that my restaurant experiences (French,Italian or otherwise at least in Europe) begin with a few rolls of bread in a basket at your table and some butter (or olive oil). They weren't far off providing one roll and your customary olive oil but with a twist in that the bottle had an opening for balsamic vinegar which made for a great blend. I had the spinach and ricotta dumplings and the waiter was kind enough to suggest having it served with the vodka cream sauce. A great choice. My two friends had the capellini primavera (which I helped finish and it was delicious) and the chicken picatta (which I did not taste but looked equally good). All that capped with a bottle of Chianit and it was a great start to our Saturday night.I'd probably recommend it for a date or with family  or a large group but definitely not for parents with young children as it wasn't necessarily the most casual place to dine."""	a11zyJN_ue0CQ_bjoeke-w	4	2009-11-30	0	0

This has nothing to do with the pasta, which was mediocre at best.  This has to do with the absolutely abysmal service we recieved.We were completely ingored for the majority of our meal.  At one point I had to go to the bar and ask our server, who was engaged in a lengthy conversation with a female patron, for a Coke refill.  When he came do the table he slammed our drinks down and left without a word.  Clearly, he was to busy flirting to be bothered with work at work.I can safely say that I will not be returning to this place.

We were told to sit wherever we wanted, we chose a booth in the lounge. The decor was nice, pretty typical for a small Italian restaurant.The service was awkward but I think the server was new, he didn't mess anything up, he just did odd things. Like he took our order and had to come back again because he forgot what my boyfriend had ordered. After our meals were delivered (by someone else) our server came by and said """"once your pasta arrives, do you want cheese? OH! It's already here! I'm blind!"""". We chose to laugh about the slightly bizarre service, we have both been the new kid before too. I liked the rolls that came before dinner but the oil/vinegar bottles were both leaky so made a mess of our hands and the table.I had the balsamic chicken, I really liked that this restaurant offers an under 650 calorie menu, as I wasn't starving and not really in the mood for pasta it was a good choice. I thought it had a good flavor and I enjoyed what I ate of it, I wasn't super hungry and had already had a lot of bread. My boyfriend had pesto chicken pasta, I noticed him doing something strange during the meal,  he kept taking a bite of his meal and then pulling pieces of chicken out of his mouth and putting it on the bread plate. I asked him what was wrong and he said """"I don't know, it's like cartilage or something, it's just...not good"""". He did finish the dish though (except for the ever growing pile of chewed chicken on the bread plate). We left and agreed that we wouldn't be back.Unfortunately, the reason for this place doesn't even deserve the 1-star, midnight found us both on the bathroom floor. Him, projectile vomiting from a textbook case of food poisoning and me playing nurse. Great way to end our Saturday date night."""	a11zyJN_ue0CQ_bjoeke-w	1	2015-10-25	0	0

That was until lastnight.  Maybe it's the state of the economy causing the need to watch their costs because they seem to be cutting back on critical ingredients.  The chicken breast in the parmesana and bianco chicken entrees were pounded to a paper thin thickness.  Also, there were very few small, diced pieces of shrimp in the penne vodka shrimp entree.  This used to be served with medium-sized, whole shrimp.  Next time when Italian food sounds appetizing, this will not be on the list.  It was very disappointing.	a11zyJN_ue0CQ_bjoeke-w	2	2008-09-07	0	0

We had good service from arrival to departure. I think we were the only customers when we arrived at 1:25.  The wine list was a disappointment.  My wife was planning on a bottle of an interesting Italian white wine but there was little to choose from.   The red wines offered more but the list was not extensive.  There are a lot of American winesTwo of us had spaghetti and meatballs. It was a good choice. The portion was very large and tasty. I have had sauce I liked better but that is a matter of preference. My wife had pappardelle bolognese. The sauce was meaty and rich and dotted with chunks of fresh mozzarella. Other friend had a chicken sandwich and was happy.  Wife and I  split a portion of flourless Chocolate cake. It was good. Friends split a pumpkin cheesecake and liked it. This is not an inexpensive lunch but the prices were not unreasonably high.	a11zyJN_ue0CQ_bjoeke-w	4	2016-11-22	0	0

On the table balsamic vinaigrette and olive oil available. We ordered a Caesar salad to share and I got the penne vodka with chicken. Pasta cooked well. Sauce was balanced. It is very good pasta. I will be returning. Environment/ambiance: very Italian restaurant. Had some TVs at the bar. Dark lighting. Outside was nice. everything was clean. Mixed crowd. More for quiet gatherings or dates.

We sat out on the patio after being immediately greeted and welcomed and given a choice of sitting in the restaurant or outside.  There is a nice mix of bar seating, dining room and patio.  We went on a Wednesday night in March so it wasn't overly busy.  The patio was nice and cozy and had good furniture and heat lamps incase.  The waiter we had was named Stallone.  He was great.  Very attentive to our needs and made us feel like we were long lost customers he hadn't seen in ages.  We also met the restaurant owner Dave who was great.  There was a medical incident in the restaurant while we were there and the staff handled the first responders and customer with attentiveness, class and dignity.  We mentioned to Dave that we heard the cannoli was recommended but overpriced according to some other Yelp reviews so he brought us one on the house.Dish portions were large and we couldn't finish what we had ordered.  Great night.  One star was lost because of the location.  Plaza is a bit sketchy looking and not in the most vibrant part of Scottsdale although it's been in that location for 20+ years which means they are doing something right	a11zyJN_ue0CQ_bjoeke-w	4	2016-03-19	1	0

The bruschetta appetizer is a favorite and I've never been disappointed in the spaghetti and meatballs. My only gripe is that they don't offer Chicken Vesuvio, which happens to be one of my most favorite Italian dishes. I'd probably visit more frequently if they did. The service is really great. The waiters -- yeah, they're pretty cute -- are friendly, attentive and accomodating. Two thumbs up for Pasta Brioni!	a11zyJN_ue0CQ_bjoeke-w	4	2008-09-14	1	1

This evening, the server, Megan, and Chef Michael Siggins outdid themselves. My dr. recently put me on a strict anti-inflammatory diet where all legumes, grains, dairy and nightshades (like tomato and eggplant) are out of the question (which sucks tremendously when dining at a fabulous Italian restaurant). Megan listened to my limitations, made great suggestions, and when she told Chef Siggins about my dilemma, he personally came out to talk to me, and ultimately created a delicious, satisfying dish that was completely in line with what I'm allowed to eat. The level of care Megan and Chef Siggins showed for my dietary limitations and the quality of the scrumptious dish I enjoyed were far and away beyond what I expected. They obviously take a lot of pride in what they do.  Many thanks and kudos!	a11zyJN_ue0CQ_bjoeke-w	5	2014-08-14	1	1

We arrived a little after 8 pm on a weeknight and immediately felt like we were intruding. They weren't closing for another hour yet the reception was cold. We sat alone in the main lounge, which was fine. Our waiter was very matter-of-fact and didn't make any attempt at chitchat; again the cold shoulder. The food was tasty and the portions ample but not worth the price, in my opinion.  There's other Italian restaurants I'll try first before coming back.	a11zyJN_ue0CQ_bjoeke-w	3	2016-08-19	1	0

1	5V8eXkTJb6IejJkMDaj_Bw	zGOWVJfQt0JiV09ZuK3bYw	Meh truly is the best rating for my experience at Pasta Brioni. I ended up there on the last day of Yelp Eats with a group of friends in a craving for Italian. From what I saw on their menu, I was very excited to see what was i store for me and had heard pretty decent things. I walked out not that excited. The ambiance inside is very nice, though a bit on the dark side. The decor inside told a completely different story than what I was thinking when I saw the entrance. It is very posh inside and I did like the comfy booths.We arrived early enough to get the early bird special, which appeared to be a better deal than the yelp eats one. I wonder if this was truly our best choice. For me when it comes to pasta, I am a bit picky. This mainly comes from the fact that I don't like really heavy sauces and I really do not like tomatoes. It has to be a good Italian place and not your run of the mill to get me excited.My first course was a Caesar salad. Wait take that back. That was supposed to be my first course. I believe I really got romaine lettuce, croutons and dressing of the day. It definitely was *not* Caesar. This left me sad. The bread with it though was pretty damn good although I suggest bigger bottles of balsamic. We ran out fast! My main course was chicken marsala and a side of penne. The penne came with a paste (note I did not say sauce) and seemed a little dry and bland. The chicken marsala was actually decent but pretty run of the mill and nothing spectacular. Dessert involved two mini cannolis. Like the pasta, they seemed a little dry and lacking, but were flavorful. Overall my meal was really just okay. The service was also nothing outstanding either, including someone having to ask for water on several occasions.	a11zyJN_ue0CQ_bjoeke-w	2	2009-08-03	2	1

It was a great night so it was comfortable, but the overhead lights being so bright it took away from the ambiance.They had specials for the night and their normal menu. One entree was sold out, rigatoni with bolognese which is probably what I would have ordered so I go spaghetti with meatballs. I am not by any means a pasta connoisseur, but this was the best spaghetti and meatballs I have ever had. Perfectly cooked, very tasty and well seasoned sauce and awesome meatballs.Someone came by and offered rolls, they were tasty however dry without anything else. Girlfriend's was a bit burnt. Prices overall are little higher than I would expect.We'll be back, I look forward to trying the chicken parm.	a11zyJN_ue0CQ_bjoeke-w	4	2014-02-16	0	0

I tried the chef salad and the quality was just low. Usually I am an indiscriminate eater, but this salad was just disgusting. Second time I ordered the rigatoni four cheese and a Caesar salad... The pasta doesn't even taste pasta. I am from Italy, and in my opinion, pasta must to be cooked in certain ways. The rigatoni were overcooked and the cheese was bitter and just not good. The Caesar salad wasn't that bad, but neither special.I am disappointed because a friend of mine recommended this place for pasta, but I didn't like it.

I hadn't been to Pasta Brioni in quite some time, but when we were organizing a bachelorette party one of us suggested this place for dinner because of the hot waiters (yeah, I'm just gonna be shallow, and not play coy about that) & its proximity to Old Town. I think they actually offer set menu deals for large parties, but with a group of girls (who may or may not by picky eaters) we didn't take advantage of this. I don't think any of the set menus include alcohol. I had the mushroom risotto & it was fantastic! It was creamy, but not too creamy, and they're was just the right amount of vegetables to risotto. I didn't care that I was amongst all girls, I happily ate the whole thing. Service was fantastic as well! I believe our waiter's name was John (I can't believe I can't 100% remember his name) & he definitely played up the fact this was a bachelorette party group. That being said, all of our orders were correct (except for one minor drink order) and everyone was very happy with the food and service. I should also point out the bachelorette got a special dessert at the end of the night ;)I would definitely come back to Pasta Brioni for any type of meal, but I would especially keep them in mind again for a large dinner party.	a11zyJN_ue0CQ_bjoeke-w	5	2014-05-01	0	1
0	9sldtsoM9MFEyPEss0L9kA	kEhSQn8zvv_P5Wz5ohxFOw	I really wanted this place to be good, especially after reading all the positive reviews on Yelp. But sadly, it was just mediocre. I was expecting good crusty italian bread for starters. What I got was a hand delivered small roll, neither crusty or warm. My wife commented how it was mealy. It was.My Pasta E Fagioli had a slight vinegar taste and not balsamic vinegar, white vinegar. Yuk.My wife ordered chicken parm with a side of meatballs. The meatballs were just ok. The chicken parm had a good flavor but the presentation looked bad. Sparsely melted cheese that looked like it had just barely melted in a microwave and not the lightly browned cheese evidencing time spent in a hot oven. I had the four cheese rigitoni which was actually pretty good. After the bread, the soup, and the yukky looking chicken parm, we chose not to spend any more $$ on desert. Service and ambiance was above average, but the food wasn't quite what we were hoping for, not for the money anyway. Our search goes on for good Italian in the Phoenix, Scottsdale area.Overall, not a bad place, but for the $$, I'll get a bottle of Rao's sauce, some meatballs from Guidos, and save the grief.	a11zyJN_ue0CQ_bjoeke-w	3	2011-09-28	0	0

They've been going there for years and raved about the place..The bread served before the meal was very good and warm. Much to my liking.Before the main meal, we ordered a caesar salad. The salad was good, but nothing exceptional. The salad was by far the least favorite part of the meal. The pasta and pasta sauce was very good. I went with a very basic dish of rigatoni bolganese.  The dish was very good and had lots of food. After filling up on bread, salad and our meal, we couldn't go for dessert, but split one. We had the chocolate ice cream in a hard shell, with hazlenut with whipped cream. The dessert was really good. I couldn't have eaten the dish by myself, but splitting it was a perfect way to end the meal with something on the sweet side.Nice atmosphere in the dining room and bar area. The decor provided a nice ambiance to the evening. Service was very good! The waiter was very attentive to our needs and water was refilled in a prompt manner.I plan on heading back there in the near future and trying other dishes..	a11zyJN_ue0CQ_bjoeke-w	4	2010-07-05	3	0

Our server brought us menus finally after he brought two waters and a basket of bread and we were told they only served pizza in the To Go room of the restaurant. I asked the server if we should take our waters over and he said """"Nahhhhhh"""" so I left them there, fully expecting we would be offered water in the separate part of the restaurant. I was wrong. Needless to say I had to ask for plates for our pizza, we were going to dine in but found out they were expecting a large party in that room as well. Right as they were about to bring our pizza and pasta (spaghetti with mushrooms/very little sausage for  $13) we asked if they would just box our food up to go and we left. Bad timing. Mediocre pasta. Decent pizza. But I certainly won't rush back. $30 for poor service, no thank you."""	a11zyJN_ue0CQ_bjoeke-w	3	2016-04-10	0	0

Mmm mmm mmm!My boyfriend and I came here on a whim after another one of our fave Italin spots in Scottsdale (NY's Best Italian) closed and we were NOT disappointed!It may not be the fanciest or most romantic place from a décor & lighting perspective, but the food is amazing and reasonably priced.I did wish they had a bit more selection on the wine list but that's really a minor complaint.I loved my eggplant and my man loved his shrimp scampi pasta. And we BOTH loved the yummy fresh bread. You have definitely NOT seen the last of us Brioni!	a11zyJN_ue0CQ_bjoeke-w	5	2017-06-27	1	1

Our waiter was excellent- friendly, interactive and funny. Everyone at the table tried a drink they liked, myself- several bellini's were taken down. Delicious!! Ordered mussels for my appetizer and they gave a great sized portion- enough to share with the table and all were open and able to be eaten. The pasta alla vodka was incredible. The portion size was huge and I definitely have a bunch left over for lunch. I highly recommend this place!	a11zyJN_ue0CQ_bjoeke-w	5	2015-11-04	0	0

But last night my boyfriend and I wanted to do a low key date night and I was craving Italian that wasn't going to break the bank. I think I can speak for both of us when I say we made a great choice in choosing Pasta Brioni. We ate on the lounge side which is very casual and low key. the vibe is like an old school Italian place- Sinatra playing and all. The food, as I expected, was delicious, but more importantly the service was top notch. Our server Brian was really awesome! Prompt, friendly and funny. I'm honestly surprised that anyone would give this place less than 5 stars.... But oh well, more pasta for me because we will definitely be back!!	a11zyJN_ue0CQ_bjoeke-w	5	2016-04-26	0	0

A nice lounge/bar area is vibrant to the left of the entrance.The bread service is awesome - scratch made rolls with a hint of parm and garlic. They were heavy in a good way - a cross between a lighter pretzel roll and either a popover or a brioche roll or maybe 1/3 the way between all three!The eggplant rolatini appetizer can easily be a light entree - with plain noodles it would be a full meal! The ricotta filling was fluffy, light, creamy AND flavorful. So good!The vitello sorrentino was amazing! Tender veal medallions dusted in flour and pan fried with a wine butter sauce.Service was excellent by Leah. They also offer pizzas and calzones mostly at lunch and we would like to try those on our next visit.	a11zyJN_ue0CQ_bjoeke-w	4	2016-08-26	0	1

My salmon was a bit on the fishy side and I was uber thirsty the entire night.   Actually had to get up out of bed for water during the night.

Memo to Brioni:  there's a craft beer revolution going on and Sam Adams and Blue Moon don't cut it any more.The bread is very good and the linguine pescatore is always a winner.I had an OK experience here but just not as good as I've remembered from past visits over the last 15 years.	a11zyJN_ue0CQ_bjoeke-w	3	2014-07-22	3	1

I also requested light sauce.  Again. Soggy.   The butter served with the bread was sweet.... ? The worse part was the loud private conversation of the wait staff and the bartender. They stood right behind us and were extremely loud, laughing shouting.....Really horrible.  The dust on the blinds (that we were right next too) was an inch thick. Needless to say, not good. I would not even call it Italian food. ..I have been to Italy and this food is more Long Island 1960's chef boyardee then anything I ever ate in Italy.  Even the beet salad was terrible.  How do mess that up, try Terrible dressing, bitter lettuce.  Some sort of beet that tasted sour and old.  We will not be back.

The place has that old school Italian feel and has a very family feel in the staff.  The visit to our table by one of the owners whom I think started out as a delivery boy? Kitchen help?  Not sure where he started but now as a co-owner he's a symbol of that family business type of venue.  The portions are big and the food is well made and the prices are very good.  The only downside was locating it.  When you're not familiar with the area it's not clear on Google Maps that it's not a stand alone place with roadside visibility.  It's in a shopping center like parking lot and you cannot see it from the street.

We were seated at a table in the bar area right away. Good service. Those rolls that everyone is loving were not warm, and didn't have much flavor. Neither did the olive oil - that was a little bit thin, too. Entree: My escort asked the server if they carry lasagna, which they do, but don't include on the menu """"along with a few other things because there's no room for it on the menu."""" ? I thought this was weird, as it's half a menu: one board with a wine list on one side and food on the other. It doesn't fold like a food menu, it's just the one piece, like a wine list. Maybe I wouldn't have ordered the rigatoni bolognese from the specials board had I had more choices and I wasn't about to make the server stand there and recite all the things they could make for me. Then again, had I done that, I might have found something to eat with a little more ... kick, if you will. I mean, my food was not bad. It was fine. But that's just it - it didn't blow me away. I could have made that and saved (my hot date) a few bucks. I had a glass of pinot from CA that was good. And the entertainment (drunk middle-aged women with an unhealthy obsession with Matt Lauer) was okay. It wasn't the worst meal I ever had, but I won't be returning because it was really no big deal. Oh, my date had that lasagna and I didn't try it, but was told """"Fine."""" when asked how it was, and he was actually talking about the food (and not some I'm-mad-at-you-but-not-telling-you boyspeak).

The sandwich is always loaded with the best tasting cutlets, sauce and just enough cheese to keep me happy. At about 10 bucks, based on the size, you should be able to eat one half only for lunch and save the rest. Unfortunately, I have only been able to accomplish that feat once due to not being able to stop eating the addictive food. The pasta salad also makes a nice side dish with it's creamy taste.

Last night, I made my way to this neighborhood pasta shop for a family dinner. My meal was spectacular. I ordered the Linguini with seafood and I'm pretty sure the entire ocean was on my plate...in a good way. They brought out the plate of Linguini with all the seafood toppings including squid, shrimp, oysters, clams and probably some fish I couldn't even name for you. At any rate, it was delish! The pasta sauce complimented the fish perfectly and I found myself eating much more of it than I should have. So speaking of seafood, Pasta Brioni accidentally must have merged with a sushi joint last night and they accidentally brought my Mom her halibut more on the """"still swimming"""" side of the plate rather than cooked. When we brought it to the server's attention he was mortified and I will say this... Because of how apologetic the server was, how they handled the situation and how accommodating they were with their mistake, I don't see a reason to have the experience alter my impression of Pasta Brioni. They brought my Mom out a new meal in record time and we were well on our way, after delicious Tiramisu and some chocolate mousse plate of goodness of course!In summary, sometimes it's entirely about how a restaurant handles unfortunate situations. It seemed like the kitchen just had a """"whoops"""" moment and that happens to the best of us, so for that I give them a get out of jail free card. Other restaurants should follow their customer service lead! Plus, I think I might have been in my own food coma of happiness from my own meal. Is it bad that I couldn't wait for my Mom to get her replacement meal and instead scarfed down my personal ocean on a plate? I did give her a little taste as she waited for her own."""	a11zyJN_ue0CQ_bjoeke-w	4	2011-03-08	6	7

We had a bunch of ladies meet up that have never been here before. We each tried a different dish while sharing a bottle of Barbara red wine. Dishes we ordered were a Cesar salad, bolonese, linguine pescatore, penne vodka---all great Italian food!  Deserts were homemade cheesecake, flour less cake and tiramisu that we ordered. Sitting in the bar area at a table was great atmosphere for our ladies laughing and telling stories. The chef stopped by our table and even stayed to chat with us. We had a great time and will be back again!	a11zyJN_ue0CQ_bjoeke-w	5	2014-09-16	0	0
1	eiG-SYiCYNe5dyr8XN8NOA	A_XyXrycaEFdnv6Sg1FyIA	I've been coming to this restaurant for about 17 years and I'm still a big fan.  Although it has had some ups and downs, the service and food have always been no less than above par.  Our most recent visit was one of the best I've had in the last past couple of years.  The service was prompt, attentive, and delivered with personality (Mike - great job).  We started off sharing the Beet salad, which was something I've never had before.  The presentation was unique and the flavor, ingredient ratio, and amount were very satisfying.  We ordered the Chicken Parmesan and Chicken Martini as entrees, which I think are some of the best in town without a doubt.  I was so eager to dive in that I forgot to take a picture.  We'll definitely be coming back again soon - more than once.	a11zyJN_ue0CQ_bjoeke-w	4	2015-02-20	1	1

0	XDZaX1izk0aVNaKXLiqhQA	lkHD0mSXkAjoy9qWhFVR5Q	I'll start with the Pros.  My meal was very good I couldn't stop eating it.  Laid back atmosphere.  Server was friendly and put together a meal for my friend that wasn't on the menu.The cons were the portion sizes were massive.  I know in the Italian culture pasta is served in big portions, but I took half of the dish home, and pasta the next day is just not the same.  Since the prices are high and you get what you pay for, I'd rather have a smaller portion with a lower price.  I ordered what I believed to be a side ceaser salad.  That was also huge, seemed like a whole head of lettuce.  It was very tasty, maybe a bit to much dressing that caused it to be not crispy.  It was also disappointing the server didn't offer to crack pepper on the salad and pasta, and offer grated cheese on the pasta.  To be honest, I would have been happy with the bread and salad and I would have been full for 6.50.  Yes, the side salad was 6.50, that was a bit ridiculous.  I had a glass of wine which was wonderful and priced very well.  So I think lowering the prices and the amount of food they give you can set this place over the top.	a11zyJN_ue0CQ_bjoeke-w	3	2010-12-13	0	0
0	zx6gq8IslnAwCyCUztXn1A	-FIrU6r9rgv0sox8C1FiOQ	I've eaten their food at least a dozen times, but have always gotten it To-Go.  Having tried several dishes, I can honestly say the food is decent.  It's not the best I've ever had, but also not the worst.  The sauce is always bland, no matter which dish I order.  I always need to spice it up, once I bring it home.Pricing is okay.  Usually spending around $35 for 2 dishes (my wife and I).  I've never utilized their delivery service, but overheard employees telling customers that they commonly run an hour and a half for delivery.	a11zyJN_ue0CQ_bjoeke-w	3	2011-02-08	1	0

Both were absolutely delicious and the portion sizes were huge!Our server was extremely friendly and made some great suggestions for dinner!

0	UBVW6XBaHRh-F6tbGi7h8g	6cDrE2DGQ8IAz-golP132g	Today the food fell a little short of expectations, I ordered the nightly special which was lobster and shrimp risotto.  The lobster tails were smaller than a typical tail, not a small portion as the dish came with two tails and two shrimp plus the risotto  The reason I mentioned the tail size is it might be a variety I have not had before, the lobster had a great grilled taste but had a texture that was not what was expected , not the buttery softness I associate with lobster (overcooked?). The risotto was cooked to the right consistency but could have used more butter and cream (or what it is they use to make risotto delicious)  I'm guessing the chef didn't taste this batch before it went out.  The staff was great, our server was Jason or Thomas. 4 stars based on years of patronage and have always experienced excellent service and quality food with today's exception on the food missing the mark..	a11zyJN_ue0CQ_bjoeke-w	4	2016-03-20	1	0

Let me tell you, for as long as it was to actually receive and consume the food.... it was worth it. The food was phenomenal, that was about it. Unfortunately it was incredibly busy due to the marathon, as well as the auctions. Meal tickets were getting lost, it was mass MASS chaos. Our waiter seemed aloof, and then after a while he started getting it together. One thing I really didn't appreciate was the fact that when we got there they sat us by the door to the outside patio (which at the time was closed). After a while someone propped the door open and it was extremely cold. I asked the host (some guy with little man syndrome) if they could close the door, he annoyingly said """"Nope, can't do it we have people outside."""" Before I could even respond, he took his little elf self and ran away. We also had our son along, this place is not so good for kids."""	a11zyJN_ue0CQ_bjoeke-w	2	2013-01-20	0	0

On my birthday a large group of us were planning on going out to dinner but did not decide on a place until the last minute.  Of course they could not take a party of 8... what was I thinking.  Anyway we came to the decision of Pasta Brioni so I gave them a call and they were very accommodating.  Within 15 minutes of getting there we were sat.  Our server was great and very knowledgeable.

Other than that, the service was top notch, the food was amazing and in large portions and overall great, old school mom and pop Italian restaurant. I got the 4 cheese Rigatoni with grilled chicken and the bf got The Chicken Parm and it was superb. Pasta done al dente just right and the grated Parm at the table, you know its authentic Italian.

Delicious, rich, cooked perfectly. Huge portion. Had more than enough to take home for another meal. My wife had the eggplant lasagna. Very good. Had the cannoli for dessert. Probably the best I've ever eaten. Why only four stars?  The waiter was completely disinterested. He came over and asked if we were ready to order. When we hesitated for a couple of seconds, he immediately said he'd come back later. Really?After our meal was served, he never returned to ask how our meal was. Or to refill our water glass. Now, this wasn't some college student. It was apparent he was one of the managers as he was dressed in a sleeves rolled up shirt and slacks.

But like most things.. you kinda just have to experience it yourself no matter what others say. Well the funny thing is I went to the cafe side which was completely empty and the menu was pretty sparse compared to the website, so right then I was disappointed and wished my date wasnt on his way to meet me there......UNTIL my date found me and brought me to the """"other side"""" which was jam packed and full of energy.. not to mention offering an extensive menu. Yay and thank god! it turns out the other side is more of the """"to go"""" side. Okay so the rolls came out and they werent awful but they weren't warm and doughy which is what i had expected from other reviews.. but that was okay. If they had been warm and doughy I would have eaten 10 so it was actually a better situation. We started with the caprese salad which they automatically split on 2 separate plates, which I thought was great initiative. I have to say that was probably the BEST Caprese I have ever had. Those tomatoes were unspeakably good! To follow I ordered the Antipasta salad it was perefect I had no complaints whatsoever. My date had a seafood pasta, I cant remember which one and he wasn't moaning over it but he definitely didn't complain. So I guess it all depends on what you order..maybe. But I was pleased enough to return sometime and try something else, no question."""	a11zyJN_ue0CQ_bjoeke-w	3	2009-10-09	1	1
0	PwXZTe-yUmohxQVcKX21UQ	IAA1UWzzgxEkguO7dYHidw	We were visiting the Phoenix area from Indianapolis wanted to find a great Italian restaurant for my Mother in law's birthday.  We chose Pasta Brioni  based on the Yelp reviews.  I have to say that our party of six had one of the worst dinning experiences of our lives.  The location is incredibly difficult to find but after driving around it for 20 minutes we found it.  We had made a reservation and were seated immediately, which I thought was great considering they were pretty full.   This is where the service stopped.We were sat without menus for 10 minutes.  Once we had menus we waited another 10 minutes for the waiter to return and give us their specials.  Each time the waiter came to our table he would say a few words and then immediately turn and quickly leave, not asking if we had any questions or God forbid if we would like a drink.  A member of our party asked the man helping and serving bread and water about a menu item.  He refused to answer only stating that he would get the waiter.  After reading the menu for 15 minutes our waiter returned to take our order.  He took our food order and turned and left.  I had to snap my fingers to get his attention when he was about 10 feet away from our table to get him to come back and finally take our drink order.  Once we had our drinks we toasted to the birthday girl during which I spilled my drink.  I quickly got up and located my waiter notified him of what had happened.  He looked like a deer in headlights and asked me what we should do.  I asked for something to clean it with and was handed a few extra napkins.  Back at the table, drink cleaned up and waiting again this time 30 minutes for our dinner.The manager? or host?  apologized and stated our meals would be out shortly.Once the meals arrived the food was good, not the best Italian I have ever had but by no means the worst either.  Definitely not worth the time that it took to receive it.My rating is based solely on the terrible service we received and that we had to try and chase down our waiter to get anything done.	a11zyJN_ue0CQ_bjoeke-w	1	2013-04-20	0	0

Definitely on the pricey side but I was taking my girlfriend to dinner on Valentine's day so that it was a special occasion. It was evident that the staff was working in a very stressful environment with almost every seat filled but I was impressed with their professionalism and friendliness regardless. The environment was beautiful as we were seated outside (thanks to the beautiful Arizona weather). Our waiter was very friendly. He was very helpful and made pleasant conversation. Many of the staff was interactive with the people and seemed to legitimately have fun in doing their job. The food was just as amazing as the service. I got the penne vodka with chicken and a garden salad. She got the rigatoni pasta with meatballs and a Ceasar salad. AMAZING. Paid 65 including a 15 dollar tip. Overall they helped make our Valentine's day experience amazing and this business deserved all the credit in the world for their amazing food and professionalism. I am a huge fan. Thanks again Pasta Brioni!	a11zyJN_ue0CQ_bjoeke-w	5	2015-02-15	0	0

The number of servers and cooks on the line were nearing the number of patrons.  The food was ok, but nothing spectacular.

3	QwOSC30OYmjUCpczgEInAw	lgBxVF5pildWB1sIglUpgQ	The stars are for service only as the manager and owner was extremely accommodating and did not charge us for the food we could not eat.. So that's the good part but you must be wondering Hope why would you go to a restaurant to not eat food?! Crazy I know, but the food was just that awful we could not force it down ! I ordered a few rolls and asked for cream cheese to be added because I like the creamy taste mixed with flavorful fish .. Keyword is flavorful . This tasted like eating a stick of cream cheese wrapped in rice, nothing else had Any flavor !! When I explained to the manager she tried to say well you added cream cheese and now you're complaining it tastes like cream cheese , fair point if there was nothing else in the roll, however a tiny amount of it should not completely over power everything else, don't blame the poor cream cheese dude, blame your lousy quality tasteless fish! We tried sashimi too and it literally had no taste on its own. The pork Gyoza was the only thing that tasted normal .. Speaking of which we asked for spicy mayo and if you have had sushi anywhere you know it's pretty thin and spicy. This was just regular thick globby mayo with probably food coloring as it was not spicy at all! Also their drinks were Flat and when I pointed it out I was told that's not possible it was just changed today ! Seriously you guys with broken taste buds stop leading us astray! Sushi station which is a revolving sushi bar tastes like 20x better than here, we went there after we left here since we only had a few bites each and were still hungry !

0	cZnnCd2X_k4iVUH_Z-CoGw	65VdciGFwz0RjoiDCFTehg	When I rate a sushi place, first and foremost importance in my criteria is the fish itself. Everything else falls into palace after that. This is where Hana excels. The fish is extremely fresh and well cut. Hamachi sashimi is about as good as I've had in AZ. I throughly enjoyed the sashimi salad as well - tons of fresh fish mixed in with nice greens and tasty dressing. As for everything else, service is good enough, pace of kitchen is satisfactory. Nothing mind blowing here, but all good enough to keep coming back. Waitstaff is friendly. They hurry you a bit sometimes but it does get busy often so it's somewhat understandable. Overall a great place for fresh quality sushi and the byob is great as you can save the markup on a great bottle of sake or wine. Sushi: excellentService: friendly, satisfactoryAmbiance: neighborhood joint. Nothing fancy, not a dump thoughPrice: very fair for some stuff, a bit overpriced for others.

It is the perfect balance -- clean, but comfortable, sophisticated, yet friendly. What's more, the food is EXCELLENT.I have been there three times so far, and I have yet to find complaint with the food. The sushi is fresh and fantastic. Hana orders whole fish, straight from the coast. The ahi I had was glossy and ruby red; the flavor delicate. It had the perfect texture, with just enough """"give,"""" so that one does not struggle with biting it, and not so soft that it lacks substance. It was also a generous portion, draped over a small, but flavorful rice ball.Their tempura has lovely and light batter, and it enrobes fresh, crisp veggies, and sweet, tender shrimp. The miso soup is also good, and they don't hold back on the goodies. For once, I found that tofu can have flavor!When I ordered the bento, it was filled with all sorts of treats! Some I could not even identify. I am embarrassed to say, I was well and truly stuffed, when I finished eating it all. Surprisingly, the prices are very reasonable! Nigiri goes for about $3-$5, maki about $5-$10, noodle dishes $80-$10, and entrees $12-$15. I have only been during lunch time, so I don't know if these change for dinner.That all said, since it is brand-spanking new, and its staff is still learning the ropes, Hana struggles a bit with service. Sometimes entrees come out poorly-timed. Sometimes you have to wait for your dishes to be cleared. You might get a bit thirsty, waiting for your refill.But it is worth it. It is so worth it.

The menu offers a selection that's more authentic than typical American-inspired """"teriyaki chicken and rice"""" styled eateries. First on my list is the sushi, which really might be the best in the Valley. Hanna opts for minalistic perfection, offering a variety of high quality, melt-in-your-mouth nigiri, and a few foundation rolls, the albacore being especially noteworthy. Secondly, the atmosphere is genuine, with a packed bistro and sushi bar or outdoor deck--yes, a deck! We ordered clams, octopus tempora, pork ramen, and a sashimi bento. I wasn't blown away by the ramen, but then the price didn't blow up our wallets either. Maybe I'm just not that into noodles. All other items were a smash hit."""

9	p_azadim_uWFOXAhhKB3ag	m8s701LF2mRgTjCCkqRtYg	What's raw, slick and makes you feel good all over? It's sushi! From trendy scenester food to its current mainstay presence, sushi has been a part of the dining scene for ages. Even with time this time spent, sushi is still very much exciting to enjoy.For me, Hana Japanese Eatery puts the amore in enamored and the fat into infatuated.With a solid menu of offerings and loads of daily specials there's plenty to keep things fresh and engaging. When I'm eating my way through the valley, almost 8 out of 10 Ill order the special when offered. In this experience Ive been able to try amazing off menu items that were seasonal or the chef was feeling whimsy that day.Not to whimsy but fully fun and interactive, Edamame ($3.95) is always a must for me. There's just something about biting into each pod and sucking the soy beans out that I find satisfying.Like something out of a dream, the sashimi, nigiri, and rolls were served on a small boat. This beautiful presentation just goes to show how attention to detail goes well beyond the food. Such things like wasabi get special attention, Hana's pickled version will make you quickly forget about the traditional paste variety. Putting the wasabi to good use, the Blue Fin ($20/$20) was ordered 2 ways, sashimi and seared, the first being my favorite, each bite almost felt like eating butter, that tender. Such favorites as Octopus ($10) and Crab Nigiri ($5) were as pretty as they were delicious.Loving rolls with contrast and crunch the Shrimp Tempura Roll ($8.50) filled both counts easily. However its special cousin, the Lobster Roll ($20), takes a California roll then is adorned with large pieces of battered quick fried lobster meat, no skimping on the good stuff here.Hot dishes on the specials menu are expertly prepared. Scallop Edamame ($10.95) takes the sweet tenderness of scallops, then is battered and rolled in soy beans and lightly fried. The texture of the buttery soy beans meshed well with the sweetness of the scallop, a must. More special menu love was felt with the sauteed Giant Clam with Scallops ($16.95). Tempura Udon ($9.95) was ordered off of the regular menu and let me tell you, those chewy noodles are simply addicting.Ive never heard the words Japanese and pizza in the same sentence before. So after our server described the Okonomiyaki ($18.95), it had to be ordered. More like a thick savory pancake in taste but the looks of a pizza, this was certainly a surprise by taste and by oddity. The top of the Okonomiyaki is sprinkled with bonito flakes which move and quiver when exposed to heat. So when it was sat down in front of me I couldn't help but stare at the movement. Yes, I was a little freaked out but how cool is that?Hana An Mitsu ($6.95) was the most perfect ending for the style of cooking. This refreshing dessert made up of aloe vera and was accompanied by oranges, blueberries & red bean paste, reminded me of an exotic fruit cocktail. If chewy and creamy intrigue you try the Ichigo Mochi Ice Cream ($4.95). The chewy rice mochi shell encapsulates your choice of ice cream, very different and tasty.Hana doesn't serve alcohol but feel free to bring your own wine, beer or sake, they wont charge you a corking fee, which makes that scallop even sweeter.

3	WnuA7ijDeUQGTp4QBqiSbg	p1XYU6v11G2k05oyWpKlWA	I've had better was what kept repeating through my head throughout dinner. Everything at Hana was decent, but nothing stood out as spectacular.Perhaps the Chef saves the best ingredients and extra effort for the daily specials, but he certainly didn't spend much time on the bento box, which is my go to when checking out any Japanese restaurant for the first time as if gives you a 'tasting menu' of what the restaurant has to offer. We also had a side of vegetable gyoza.The Good:  - the Salmon sashimi was quite good, fresh and flavorful- the tempura was great, light and crisp- the pickled vegetables were a nice addition to the standard bento fare. - the white ginger was nice and refreshing, a step up from the standard pink ginger at most sushi places.- great neighborhood vibe - small and intimate with a modern Asian vibe than isn't overly 'faux-Japanese' or 'trendy'- quick, friendly serviceThe Not so Good- the tuna sashimi tuna had the telltale mushy flavorless that comes from being previously frozen) - the 'chef's choice' sashimi (A white fish, but we didn't get a chance to ask what it was) was flavorless (although not mushy!)- the California rolls were quite disappointing - imitation crab meat and over mayo-ed (why do California rolls even need mayo?)- the wasabi lacked kick. (I'll be sure to ask for fresh if I visit again)- the gyoza tasted like the came pre-made and frozen.One comment on the BYOB.  While I usually like the idea of BYOB, (especially with no corkage fees), at a Japanese restaurant, i usually like ordering Sake or Japanese beer that can be hard to come at regular retail outlet in Phoenix).Overall, the experience wasn't memorable.  I may come back when the sushi urge hits (and order off the daily special menu), but it won't be a priority otherwise, especially with all the great other restaurants popping up in uptown Phoenix.

The place is small, so get there early if not be prepared to wait for a table.  I ordered the gyoza (Japanese Pan steamed dumplings), I was pretty good.  For my entrée, I ordered the Hana Katsu (Golden breaded chicken breast infused with Koso butter).  Wow, it was good...  Lightly breaded, fried just right, chicken was juicy, and Koso butter was a good touch of flavor.  For my dessert, I got the cream filled tempura (cream lightly battered to a golden crunch).  It was done just perfect.  The service was pretty good, she double check our orders maybe due to a language barrier, but either way our order came out perfect.

Expect a 20-40 minute wait on weekends as its popular among the locals. Owned privately and well managed, the service was impeccable. The table was frequently cleaned and maintained by anyone in the vicinity. The Sushi was fresh, mild and tender as should be. I would give 5 stars except for the host and hostess lack of attention to the wait list. We waited 50min instead of the 20 we were told. They just overlooked us.

This is Hana Japanese Eatery on 7th St.Corkage, byob!This is my favorite sushi/japanese restaurant in town right now.  Unfortunately they do not serve alcohol, but you can bring your own sake, wine or beer (just stop at AJ's on Camelback and Central on your way in).  Incredibly fresh and delicious sashimi and sushi, always fabulous specials on the board, and interesting items like fresh halibut or red striped bass really make for some great sashimi.  Service can be excellent to horrible (had a very bad server at lunch once) but is normally excellent, this is a family run business and the Japanese influence is seen in the fabulous dishes.  Make sure you order your favorite sushi rolls or sashimi, even if it isn't on the short menu.  They are glad to make anything you ask for if they have it available.  I had one of the best salmon skin handrolls i've had anywhere in the world here.  And the tuna tataki with crunchy roasted garlic was out of this world.  I'm a sashimi lover but these specials on the board have to be ordered because they are that good.   One night they had a special seaweed with lemon peel and green onions that I will order any time I see it available, amazing flavor and texture, very japanese.  mmmm.Not open for lunch on Saturday or Sunday, closed on Mondays.

There was also ample space in the parking lot.I had the Hana Bento Box, which could easily have feed two people! You begin with miso soup and a small salad, and then the box arrives, overflowing with food. In the box is a delicious assortment of vegetables, an assortment of tempura vegetables and shrimp (the batter was so light and crispy and perfect, the vegetables were a wonderful assortment, and both the shrimp & the veggies were perfectly cooked), 6 pieces of different sashimi, a California roll, and a slice of orange. My only regret is that I didn't take a picture because it was phenomenal!Thanks Hana--I'll be back!	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	5	2016-08-12	0	0

HOWEVER there are 2 sushi restaurants in Phoenix named Hana and they are NOT the same.The one you should end up at is called Hana Japanese Eatery and is located at 5524 N 7th Ave Phoenix. It is NOT the Hana Sushi located #3, 602 West Union Hills Drive  Phoenix, AZ 85027. We found this out the hard way after Googling Hana and driving to the wrong location.We realized right away we were at the wrong Hana and left immediately to find the right one.Glad we did as the Sushi at Hana Japanese Eatery was some of the best we have eaten in a long time. Rolls were unique, large, an very fresh! Service was excellent as well and prices very fair for the high quality Sushi that arrived on our table. Also one of the best Miso soups wee have had in a long time. Our absolute favorites of the rolls we ordered were  the Spicy Tuna hand rolls and the Baked Salmon roll. Just incredible! A first for us as well was that along with the standard Wasabi Paste you get at every Sushi joint, you also get fresh chopped Wasabi plant. It looks like relish when they serve it, but it's actual Wasabi plant. It's fiery hot and really awesome on the sushi. It is clear why this place is rated highy by Zagat and well reviewed. Amazing and Fresh Sushi with great service!! 5 Stars well deserved.	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	5	2012-10-15	0	0

It was home. I loved the people and the culture. The way the earth and the ocean offer the other balance there. The night life and let us not forget ever, the food. Well Hana is not it... :PBut it is still pretty damn good. I love coming here with my mom. I am always trying to push her to eat something new! She is typical fraidy cat and wont hardly touch sashimi which is delicious here. One piece and she's out. I have ordered tuna tataki here (one of my favourite meals in the world) but I don't think it is on the menu, and for me they over sear the fish. I like it just lightly fire kissed. The rolls here are pretty typical. Avocado and cream cheese to satisfy my mother and cover up any real flavor of the fish. The miso is really very good here. Its always hit or miss with miso in the states... Usually extremely too salty, but here has always been good. The tempura platters are shazaam! Fun and delicioso. In conclusion, i suggest you give it a try. Don't forget to bring your own booze, an empty tummy, and an open mind!	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	4	2013-01-03	9	8

Hana is not your typical Japenese restaurant, it's the real deal and offers an extensive menu.  A few of the items we ordered were the Salmon & Albacore Sashimi and it was so fresh.  They provide both fresh and wasabi spread which is wonderful.  Their Albacore was truly some of the best I've ever had which was topped with browned scallions, and avocado slices. Hana is Japenese owned and operated restaurant which explains the attention to detail, as well as the amazing menu.  Rick, their Sushi chef prepared our sushi and it was beautifully prepared, as well incredibly fresh.  I also want to give a shout out to our waiter today, Jake, who took great care of us and did a really great job providing us with some really wonderful recommendations. It's alway so nice when the wait staff knows the menu.  I was also pleased to find out that Hana also offers BYOB, and even provides a wine bucket and glasses. I will have already recommended Hana to many of my friends and this will definitely be one of my regular places to eat.	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	5	2016-12-22	0	0

I dine in sometimes, but I often get it to go, since I live nearby. It's pretty busy in the nights, especially the weekend. The nigiri and sashimi are my favorites on the menu. My usual run to Hana includes eel nigir, tuna sashimi, yellowtail sashimi, and sometimes salmon sashimi. They are very generous on their cuts of sashimi, and I don't feel ripped off as I have at other restaurants with paper thin slices of fish. They are always mindful if you have any food allergies and will ask you up front if you have any. So all you lactose-intolerant folks, definitely check out this place. Expect to pay around $40 for a nice amount of sushi, but you will leave satisfied and know you're paying for fresh and great quality food.	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	5	2013-10-21	2	1

Hana is one of them.Sushi is meant to be eaten in a single bite. Unlike most sushi restaurants in America, the chefs prepare the fish for nigiri sushi/sashimi thin and tender. This is how it is in Japan! Not the chunky block of fish you usually get. Sure, you feel like you are getting more value for your dollar but the whole idea around Japanese cuisine is balance, taste and esthetics. Too much fish overpowers the delicate flavor of the seasoned rice. Either way, their sushi is always fresh and delicious and creative. While cream cheese is not widely used in Japan, you can still get your Americanized sushi if you want it so you get a nice balance between authentic and neo-cuisine. I highly recommend any of their nigiri options (slice of fish on top of a bite of seasoned rice). We've tried a few of their rolls too and were not disappointed.My favourite dish is their Tonkatsu Ramen. It is sort of off-menu; you have to request it. And it is amazing. The broth is a rich pork broth, made from boiling pork bones for literally hours and hours. The noodles are tender with a wonderful chewy-ness to them and the garnishments are wonderful. Takes me back to my childhood, slurping soup out of the bowl from a tiny shoppe in an alley, steaming my face in the rich aroma of pork. A recent trip to Japan reminded me of just how much I love that dish and Hana does it up right. In fact, they've won awards for their Ramen! Best in Arizona!They also have some of the best Tempura available! Tender, light and delicious. I have yet to have a greasy tempura dish set before me from Hana. Try their Agedashi Tofu - Tofu squares battered, deep fried and then served with a light tempura sauce poured over. The batter turns gummy (in the best possible way), the tofu is piping hot (as in, be careful!) and the flavor is delicate and comforting. Oh! And the Hamachi Kama (this is the collar of the Yellowtail fish) is out of this world. Broiled perfectly so that the meat has a nice char but is still tender and moist. Served with a traditional ponzu (soy-citrus) sauce. YUM! (I'm making myself hungry!)Other traditional Japanese dishes are offered from their """"Japanese Menu"""". It isn't always handed to you at the table. Sometimes you have to ask for it. Most of the items found on this menu are visible on the chalkboard above the sushi bar too. Be sure to try them! They're terrific. I recommend the Takoyaki (little balls of seasoned dumpling, stuffed with cooked octopus and then topped with Kewpie Mayonnaise and other delicious toppings) and the cold soba (cold buckwheat noodles that you dip in a subtle soy/ponzu sauce.) Wonderful in Summer and surprisingly hearty for such a light dish!. Their main dinner menu features steak, chicken and lobster prepared in their own Hana style. It's pretty yummy but I admit that I tend to stick to the more traditional stuff. Price-wise, they are within the typical range for a Japanese eatery. My husband and I typically spend around $50-60 for dinner but he eats a LOT of sushi so...The staff is always friendly, enthusiastic and attentive. The place really has good food so don't be surprised if there is a wait. It is a small place (they are expanding soon) so there are a limited number of tables. But they turn their tables around rather quickly so typically your wait is not longer than 30-40 minutes on a very busy Friday evening.  This is a BYOB establishment. You bring your beer, sake or wine and they'll uncork it for you and provide fresh glasses. My only complaint (and this is entirely a ME thing) is that it can get rather loud in there. I'm accustomed to the quiet atmosphere you find in Japan but not at Hana. I'm sure it is just because so many people are talking so enthusiastically about how delicious the food is! Footnote: My daughter is deathly allergic to shellfish but loves sushi. I like that this restaurant routinely asks about food allergies every time we order and they are careful to keep shellfish well away from her order so we can all enjoy without having to worry if we'll have to cart her to the ER!"""

We got take-out there the other night for a light meal and managed to spend $30 on a regular spicy tuna roll, a specialty roll and side of steamed rice. $30 seriously? And the specialty roll was only 6 pieces which was disappointing given the cost. Looks like Hana is starting to cut back with prices staying steady or increasing. A sign in the front alerts patrons who want to split checks that there will be a $1.50 charge on each bill """"given the recent economy."""" I find that pretty unbelievable. Anyways, the food is generally pretty good. One of my favorites is their Hana salad although I was pretty disappointed when they began layering the bottom of the salad with iceberg lettuce instead of the usual mix. Again with the cut-backs. Don't get me wrong. I like Hana alot but I think they are becoming overpriced for food that is good but in an average way comparable to other Asian spots."""	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	3	2010-04-13	5	2

We waited 20 minutes to get seated and the restaurant and the place was empty! The food came out before they even brought out the water. Would never recommend this place to anyone.

Everyone raved about the sea bass and salmon sashimi.  The fried oyster appetizer was crispy and tasty.  Also loved the tofu appetizer -- delicately fried chunks of soft tofu in a soy broth.  I love the old school boats for serving the sushi.  My favorite option was the spicy tuna roll, which was actually spicy and not slathered in mayo like most sushi bars in town.  It's BYOB, and they don't have a corkage fee.  I'll definitely be going back!	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	5	2008-04-12	3	1

It is small so it can get crowded fast, but we've always had good service.	CUivTcULsu5MJIYYNVm1zw	5	2013-04-19	0	0
