When you walk out the front door Scott Monument and Princes street are right in front of you, Edinburgh Castle and the Royal Mile is a 2 minute walk via a close right around the corner, and there are so many hidden gems nearby including Calton Hill and the newly opened Arches that made this location incredible.The hotel itself was also very nice with a reasonably priced bar, very considerate staff, and small but comfortable rooms with excellent bathrooms and showers. Only two minor complaints are no telephones in room for room service (not a huge deal for us) and no AC in the room, but they have huge windows which can be fully opened. The staff were incredible though, letting us borrow umbrellas for the rain, giving us maps and directions, and also when we had lost our only UK adapter for charging our phones gave us a very fancy one for free.I would highly recommend this hotel to friends, and when I return to Edinburgh (which I most definitely will) I will be staying here without any hesitation.	uYHaNptLzDLoV_JZ_MuzUA	5	2016-07-12	0	0

Pros:Great location- you're right by the train station, central location to get to old town and new town, and right by sight seeing his tours. Food, bars, and shopping all within walking distance. Location, location, location.Very clean and very good maid serviceCons:Tiny rooms Uncomfortable bed Absolutely no amenities No phone in room No wardrobe Was given a lot of attitude about me and my husband sharing a room which was quite strange and we were charged 15 pounds more for double occupancy not sure why that matters I felt like it was a money grab. It was just handled in a kind of odd manner to me... If you book this hotel all you get is a bed, desk, and a bathroom. It isn't awful but know what you're getting into.	uYHaNptLzDLoV_JZ_MuzUA	3	2016-10-02	0	0

Von diesem hier waren wir nach dem überraschend positiven Erlebnis im Motel One an der Princes Street [1] etwas enttäuscht.Das Hotel ist wesentlich größer und extrem unübersichtlich. Da man auf der fünften Etage noch Teile eines weiteren Gebäude, das mittels einer Glasbrücke mit dem Hauptgebäude verbunden ist, hinzugenommen hat, kann die Suche nach dem Zimmer insbesondere auf dieser Etage zu einem Gang im Labyrinth ausarten. Habe ich so noch in keinem Hotel erlebt - uns begegneten immer wieder Menschen, die sich auf der Suche nach ihren Zimmern verirrt haben.Unser Zimmer war ähnlich aufgebaut wie das Zimmer im Motel One Princes Street - befand sich jedoch im Inneren des Gebäudes und hatte daher kein Fenster. Nur eine kleine Dachluke, die sich am oberen Ende eines etwa 3m langen Schachts befand, sorgte für einen minimalen Anteil Tageslicht im Zimmer. diese Luke ließ sich auch nicht öffnen, nur ein elektrisches Rollo ließ sich mittels eines Schalters öffnen bzw. schließen.Sonst gilt für das Zimmer eigentlich das Gleiche wie für das Zimmer im im Motel One Princes Street: Relativ klein, trotzdem extrem ansprechend und schick gestaltet und clever durchdacht. Dazu sehr ruhig.Im gesamten Hotel gibt es kostenloses WLAN für die Dauer des Aufenthalts für maximal 3 Geräte.Die Lage des Motel One Royal Mile ist großartig. Vom Airlink-Flughafenbus kann man quasi in den Hoteleingang stolpern, es sind maximal 50m. Zur Royal Mile sind es etwa 100m Luftlinie (bergauf) und man benötigt etwa 5 Minuten bis dort.Das Frühstück für 9,50 GBP / Person kann man nutzen - muss man aber nicht. Es ist eher übersichtlich und kontinetaler Prägung, trotzdem aber sehr gut. Für den gleichen Preis oder weniger bekommt man aber problemlos ein reichhaltiges Frühstück in einem der zahlreichen Cafes von Edinburgh.Für ein oder zwei Nächte kann man hier problemlos bleiben, sollte aber nicht allzuviel erwarten. Hat man die Wahl, sollte man meiner Erfahrung nach lieber auf das andere Motel One an der Princes Street ausweichen. ----[1] http://www.yelp.de/biz/motel-one-edinburgh-2?hrid=7UDwl3s_DuOokkGPZXZgBw	uYHaNptLzDLoV_JZ_MuzUA	3	2015-09-17	0	0

They are very helpful and have a lot of patience answering all my questions about where to go etc. there is also a lounge open 24 hours with snack-type food. Breakfast is continental-style so if you want heartier fare look elsewhere though you don't have to go far. The bus and train stations are right across the street so it's easy access to the airport or anywhere else you may want to go. Turn uphill to old town or cross the bridge to new town. The room with a view i got was spacious and comfortable though it's a bit of a maze to find it-just follow the signs. The windows are double paned so the room is quiet plus i was on the 5th floor which helps. It's a bit pricey but still one of the best values i found!	uYHaNptLzDLoV_JZ_MuzUA	4	2016-08-21	0	0

0	zXnH6W74FAJQ7q7b-NuBsA	cUgvEy5wj7zYE68v1BzzVg	This is a fairly new property I think. It is a German company and has most of the amenities you would want. It is priced on the budget minded side so it won't break your bank.Location is really good. Near the Royal Mile and Waverley station without being too noisy. Very easy to walk to everything we wanted to do. Has WiFi but we did have to re-log in every day.	uYHaNptLzDLoV_JZ_MuzUA	4	2013-07-07	0	0
0	c5yp5hxwC1N98MjbV2LyWQ	FSB_BnvysBgH3JYrbFNcgw	First time at this group of hotels. Pretty new, only one in UK, another to open in Edinburgh and one in London. Rooms not very big but great price and location for a weekend in Edinburgh. Rooms clean, comfortable, good shower and free wifi!	uYHaNptLzDLoV_JZ_MuzUA	4	2013-04-27	2	2
0	xJisL5w4wOgiYLokGMT_IA	dhl3ZW9aAEX_T7_um5tfaQ	Location location location! Motel One is just right in the middle of everything. To one side you have the New town and the main trains station ( and right in front of the airport bus)  and on the other side the beautiful old town of Edinburg. The room was small but clean and with all you need. The bathroom was also small but nice and clean and the shower was big and good! Next to the bed there is a European plug (CC 7/7) so we actually didn't need to use our adapter. The beed was to hard for my back and I prefer the bed more soft, but I will still come back to Edinburgh and Motel One.	uYHaNptLzDLoV_JZ_MuzUA	4	2015-04-13	2	0
1	tgV6tsYQ66DZ3LQKvtC6cw	JQJvnM3p-3eML05eKcTgiw	A hotel that has all the basics that you'd need - no additional fuss. For the price we paid, I'd say this place is actually pretty good value. The location is super central and it's easy to get to everywhere from here! It's also right next to the airport shuttle bus and train station, so transport is also easy. The insides is a bit of a maze depending on where your room is located - you may have to go down to go up to go back down again to get to your room! But no bother, it's good for walking off the chips and sobering from your drinks.	uYHaNptLzDLoV_JZ_MuzUA	4	2016-11-08	1	1
0	Q-3YCVywc03w56wYtGlKvg	6JF4WfHgwYrrdZ2VeYtnFw	Stayed here for two nights, costs was £109 per night for two people sharing a room which was not a budget price for what felt like budget rooms. Firstly they don't have any twin rooms in the hotel which would be preferable when I was sharing with a friend not my lover! There is only one small bin which is located in the bathroom.  No soap, which I find ridiculous, only toiletries were a dual shower gel/hair wash. There was a hairdryer but no wardrobes or drawers. Room was also very cold. Now for the positive, the location is very good, close to princes street and St. Andrews square. The staff are very helpful and the bar is 24 hours. Don't bother with the breakfast which is £9.50 each for a continental breakfast where you can easily get a cooked breakfast in any one of the cafes in Cockburn Street, which is adjacent to this hotel. If I go to Edinburgh again I will book a different hotel.	uYHaNptLzDLoV_JZ_MuzUA	3	2015-07-27	1	0
0	Cx4UCow0zQgFQOp47RRRaA	fbVYETRuWDw8QnpimpGMpg	Well, i like the idea of Motel One. Always in the center of the city, somehow modern design, good beds. No fancy unnecessary stuff. All of this is true for this motel one in Edinburgh. Perfectly located even if it's hard to discover. Breakfast is ok, but not more. Service is friendly. No twin rooms available..	uYHaNptLzDLoV_JZ_MuzUA	4	2014-05-07	1	0
0	eqWEgMH-DCP74i82BEAZzw	lobj38NgaokqVseN8_nn6g	I really do love the Germans. This chain is spreading fast over there and they're bringing their efficiency and attention to detail with them here. Motel One is, as the name suggests, aimed at the budget market. Rates for this venue range from approximately £69/night up. I booked ahead and appreciated the completely free reservation process with room guaranteed until 6pm on the day of arrival. If you give your credit card details, it's reserved beyond that time.Location is excellent! If you exit from the Market St side of Waverly and turn right it's maybe 3 minutes away. It would be very hard to have it closer. That also makes it very close to the castle and Princes St. Welcome was warm and check-in easy. The lobby area is pretty small but clean and cosy with sweets, maps etc. There's a bar area down a few steps where they also serve the buffet breakfast each morning.My room was the cheapest version and was internal, facing onto a courtyard. It had no view and was quite dark, but quiet. Everything was completely spotless. The bathroom was small but well designed and had a great shower. Bed was comfy with 2 single duvets. So continental, don't you know? I appreciated the tea and coffee making facilities (I'm like a beast without them), the decent sized TV and the free wifi. The hanging storage facilities are limited but it was fine for a few days. Random: hands down the best hotel hairdryer I have ever used. And one of the best dryers in general-called a Black Mambo. It was worth staying there for that alone. Well, you know, also the really good value and the pristine conditions. But definitely the hairdryer.	uYHaNptLzDLoV_JZ_MuzUA	4	2015-02-26	1	0
0	d0DGZRp6lHXGECJSc_nn-A	ysfjtAWreLoy7um8WTb8xA	Motel One sets the standard for budget hotels. I stayed at the Dusseldorf branch a while ago so when I saw one in Edinburgh, I knew this was the place to book. We managed to get a reservation during the Edinburgh Fringe Festival and only booked a few weeks before. We did pay a premium over the normal rate but given the crowds in the city during this time, it was still a good deal compared to other hotels.Staff were all friendly and welcoming, presentable and professional.We received a room upgrade with quite a large room overlooking the bridge crossing Waverley station to Princes St. Despite overlooking a busy road, the room was almost silent thanks to solid double glazing. The room temperature was perfectly controlled with an individual A/C unit. Super clean, modern, uncluttered. Bathroom was similar. No slamming doors or noise in the night. Bonus.Free wifi that works with one log in (doesn't require repeated log ins as some places do) and had decent signal strength.The buffet continental breakfast was also a hit with fresh croissants, danishes, cold cuts, cheese, toast, fruit and yoghurt all well presented, fresh and good quality as was the coffee.If I am looking for a reasonable hotel in a city, Motel One will be by first choice.	uYHaNptLzDLoV_JZ_MuzUA	5	2015-08-21	1	1
0	IpLZ7RevQrFPJWYc9Gxymg	OF1ToqGAubsWGri5iad15w	Had Continental style breakfast here a short distance from Waverley Station as I had half hour before a train home and wanted to try somewhere new. Motel1One is nearby and a easy two minute walk, slightly uphill towards the castle from the station. On entry it's modern, cosy has tons of cool yet bright pastel and mochilato colours to accommodate your cold wintertime self. Wooden floors, warm rugs, sheepskins on the sofas, slate walls and oak barrelled tables, with slight distinct Scottish themes due to their tartan furnished accessories completes the feel.I sat in One Lounge, had tea and food self served for well under £10, you know bran, meats cheese and croissant that sort of stuff. With a copy of local newspaper in hand I really needed to eat, stay warm and access wifi, the reasons I came in.Some hotels in the city give you access to wifi if your a paying guest, but repeated attempts to access their wifi even with staff help, eventually gave access but in German. On going to reception again for additional help the staff were great got the correct website for me, but still no luck.Hmmm, by the time this was all done I came back to cold tea and didn't really have time now to finish a second cup of hot Earl Grey, so sorry to staff for removing an almost full cup of tea. Great place though nice breakfast and funky decor especially the plasma tv displaying a roasting log fire in reception, but sadly for me no easy access to wifi when badly required.Maybe next time I will endeavour to try food against technology!	uYHaNptLzDLoV_JZ_MuzUA	3	2013-12-07	1	0

I cam and my food was ready for me. Driving home the smell in my car was so good I could barely wait to get home and try it - true umami!I got home and dug into the delicious spicy chicken and rice with sugar snapies and carrots. It was superb! For $9 I will definitely try this again!

1	Ji9PeffxjwqPLO7pEfSpKQ	G-EFA005besj5uHsH0sQFA	"I'm not saying Pei Wei is the best asian food I've ever tasted, far from it, it's a fairly large chain that puts on the appearance of something more refined, it's essentially to Asian food what Olive Garden is to Italian Food.With that said I've always had pretty good experiences with Pei Wei, the food although not spectacular is better than some of the overcooked chicken drowning in MSG offered by some of the local chinese restaurants.  the portions are good sized, the food is generally consistent, and the prices are really reasonable considering this is a corporate chain in some cases cheaper than the local establishments. or dare I say it's name ""panda express"" (which is overpriced crap)the time before last that I went they forgot the tomato's and the dressing for an asian chopped chicken salad that my wife ordered, I didn't discover that the dressing was missing until I got home, I immediately called the restaurant and was speaking to a manager within 30 seconds. The manager apologized and asked me If I would like to come back to the restaurant or if he could have my address so he could send me a gift certificate. I decided to go back to the restaurant, when I got the restaurant I told the person at the counter my name and they already had a bag set aside for me, the manager came over and explained to me there was another full salad in the bag, and he put additional dressing for the salad we already had, and additionally he gave me a coupon for free lettuce wraps.(which mental note: I need to use)I must say I was impressed with this manager, and it was refreshing after being in situations where a manager has taken back the bag/plate and essentially ""un-F$@k's"" your food and returns it to you.Overall great customer service, consistent food, and a good option for takeout in surprise."	jQsNFOzDpxPmOurSWCg1vQ	3	2009-01-12	1	1

I'm highly dissatisfied with the flavor of the food. This  should be labeled Asian inspired and not Asian. I've tried a variety of Chinese restaurants, this doesn't taste close to anything I've had at other Asian restaurants. Their Mongolian beef  was 5 pieces of beef and large mushrooms cut into thirds in a thick sauce. You eat the rice to wash off the nasty flavor. My shrimp was thickly coated in an overpowering  sauce as well.  I only ate some of the veggies that take center stage on a meat dish.  The center of my pork egg roll was cold. The hot N sour soup was a much thicker consistency almost like that of a chili instead of being brothy. Worst of all was the price.  This was not worth it to us. Neither me or my husband enjoyed either of  our dishes.  We didn't even eat half of our plates.  We even refused to take it home with us.  If you like and enjoy what typical Asian food tastes like,  don't waste your time here.	jQsNFOzDpxPmOurSWCg1vQ	1	2015-05-22	0	0

We came and there was an unknown issue that required a 25 minute wait for food.  The employee notified us, and although hesitant, we decided to stay.  We have been here numerous times before in the past years so we are familiar with this location.  The employee was apologetic and gave us a free drink.  That was a simple gesture but rarely do you see decent customer service anymore.  We received our food and had an issue with an incorrect order.  It was explained and the issue was resolved quickly.  They gave us a free appetizer.  We do not expect perfection, nor free food.  This restaurant cares for customers and works to provide a positive experience.  We would return again because they have good food and they care.  That is a rarity in today's restaurant culture.  Kudos to the manager for creating this culture.  Ordered- fried rive and Tofu, edamame, won ton soup, dynamite chx, and Thai curry chx	jQsNFOzDpxPmOurSWCg1vQ	5	2017-03-12	0	0

Be aware that they use shitake mushrooms is almost everything, but they are fine with custom orders if you don't want them. All in all, it's not my favorite place, but I always enjoy it every time."	jQsNFOzDpxPmOurSWCg1vQ	4	2009-06-25	2	1

The hubs ordered Mongolian Beef (his fav at PF Chang's) and I ordered my ""tried and true"" Ginger Broccoli and Chicken."" Of course we started with the Lettuce Wraps because honestly...they are just the most delicious things ever!Tonight we were pleasantly suprised that the food was quite delicious. Although the dishes are EXACTLY like what you would get at PF Chang's they are scrumptous in their own right. The only downfall is that the noise isn't conducive to conversation.  I haven't been to an establishment this noisy since Buca de Beppo's...which I love (don't get me wrong)!  But I will say (on a positive note) that the customer service is fabulous! Something that can be hard to come by at times...As for price....$28 bucks for the two of us including an appetizer, two entrees and two drinks. (coke and iced tea...with free refills) Seems a bit pricy to me but honestly....EVERYTHING is expensive now days. Overall, try it out...they offer take out too so you can enjoy great food in the comfort of your home....without all the noise!

We get home and they forgot to put the crab puffs in my bag. Didn't bother going back and moved on to our meals. My honey glazed chicken was average, edible. My husbands sweet and sour chicken was so soggy it was disgusting! Couldn't even eat it. My daughter loves fried rice and wouldn't even eat hers, it was so greasy.

We were served quickly and the staff was friendly! The restaurant was clean and tables were bussed quickly. I was disappointed with my Mongolian chicken. It tasted more like Teriyaki and was swimming in sauce. I had at least a 1/3 cup of sauce left on my plate after eating my food.All in all, PeiWei's food will be why I don't return anytime soon even though their staff was excellent and so was the atmosphere.	jQsNFOzDpxPmOurSWCg1vQ	2	2014-10-01	0	0

0	R-kL1bocHgP4GW7Mgd-ZXA	nI2rhDM2CgNazMdhiODoRQ	OH MY GOD, this place. I used to like Pei Wei until I moved to Surprise and this location ruined it for me. They consistently screw up on orders, have huge wait times, and run out of key ingredients on an alarmingly regular basis. We just spent an hour waiting for a take out order (kung pao veggies and vegetable fried rice), which was twice the time they quoted us, only to be told they were out of WHITE RICE (how does a chinese restaurant fail to foresee the possibility that they might serve a lot of white rice on a Saturday night?!). I may have chosen to stick around the extra 15 minutes if they hadn't already had to re-make half my order after making it incorrectly the first time. When I change up an order even slightly to accommodate for allergies/dietary needs, they have to re-make it at least 75% of the time.If the food was consistently delicious, I'd rate it higher, but honestly, it's only okay.	jQsNFOzDpxPmOurSWCg1vQ	2	2016-02-14	0	0
5	6jz_Yr6_AP2WWLbj9gGDpA	sb7iYaCc6ggpShtElkcwiw	My wife wanted to try this place for awhile now.  One of her brothers friends used to be a manager of one in Colorado too.  Tonight we decided to try it out.I placed my order online.  Easy process.  My wife went with an order of Chicken Lo Mein and I went with Sesame Chicken/Steak with fried rice as well as an egg roll and 2 pot stickers.  Total for everything was $24.80 after tax.  I drove down and picked up my food.  The manager their was friendly, rang me up real quick and I was out the door in no time. This bag was heavy as hell too!   Here is how everything tasted.....................Chicken Lo Mein-  Only had a little of this.  Good noodles, good white meat chicken.  My wife liked it.Sesame Chicken/Steak-  I decided to try out 2 kinds of meat.  They let you mix and match which is cool...they charge you for the highest priced item.  I substituted fried rice for white rice (.99 cents extra).  This was touted as soy citrus glaze, red bell peppers, onions, scallions, ginger, garlic and chile paste and sesame seeds.  It was just alright.  The flavors didn't really do much for me.  It was a tad spicy from the chile paste but overall it was kind of bland.  I had some pieces of steak/chicken that were a bit funky too.  I would definitely try out a different dish next time here...if there is a next time ;-).  The fried rice was good!Egg Roll- Eh.  It was an egg roll.  Nothing fantastic about it but it tasted fine.  It came with a sweet mustard dipping sauce which was pretty tasty.  Usual fillings of pork, veggies etc.Deep Fried Pot Stickers-  I got 2 of these things.  They were good.  Small but good.  Straight pork filling in the middle of them.  Overall it was just alright.  I will say that they give you a GRIP of food.  The 2 entrees we got could have easily fed 1-2 more people.  For $24.80 it was a great value.  The food just wasn't the type of thing that  you would ever crave and keep you coming back though.  While I was eating my meal, all I could think of were better Chinese food places I have had before....wishing I was eating them instead.  It filled my belly, service was friendly and the value is definitely there.  I'll probably give them another try and order some other dishes to see if there is something I really like.  We shall see............	jQsNFOzDpxPmOurSWCg1vQ	3	2015-02-12	7	6

I loved the tofu and the brown rice and the veggies. My friend ordered the lo mein and she loved it. We didn't finish due to the fact that the portions are huge. (we didn't know it was a like share the bowl type of place, and when we figured it out we didn't do it because hers had meat). But overall this place was amazing. The employees are very very nice!

I wouldn't recommend this place to any health conscious people. To top it all its expensive. Go to taco bell or China Panda and save your frustration and your appetite. Just being fancy is not the attraction motto for me. Maybe they will train their managers to change the attire of the restaurant. I wont waste my time here.	jQsNFOzDpxPmOurSWCg1vQ	1	2011-02-27	0	0

Sometimes they tell me they never even received my order when I received the confirmation email. Also, if you in during a busy time and have a teenage girl as a cashier, you're chances of having a pleasant experience with her are slim to none. This has happened to me multiple times with multiple different cashiers. I have spoken to the manager and he is always very apologetic, but I guess you just can't get stressed teenage girls to be nice to customers. I will continue to go here as the food is good for the price and they are relatively quick with preparation. Nice options if you're veggies as well.	jQsNFOzDpxPmOurSWCg1vQ	4	2016-02-13	0	0

Take out rocks, call ahead.  They remember your phone number and name, so when you call they already know you.  They also save your last order to ask if you want the same, or to add anything to it... Nice touch.  I think I eat there too much! The only thing I don't like, and I think I'm the only one who doesn't like it, is the soda machine.  Only because I always get a soda after someone has pumped out some nasty combination of orange soda and root beer, then I can taste it in my coke.  Wish they had some filter system.  Otherwise, I could eat here daily.  Find me here at least once a week! :)	jQsNFOzDpxPmOurSWCg1vQ	5	2012-07-08	2	1

Same thing with the sweet and sour beef.Ordered the Pad Thai without peanuts... Son is allergic to peanuts so we made it very clear we didn't want anything with nuts.  They deliver the pad Thai with peanuts all over the top.  Sent it back and they fixed it.They brought us spring rolls which we did not order.  We said they were not ours we ordered wontons.  They bring us the wontons a few minutes later.  The wontons are less expensive than the spring rolls, we point that our to the guy at the register and with a bit of smart-alecky-ness says that he ""let us keep the spring rolls"" and ""didn't charge is for all of our drinks"" as if he did us a favor.Overall the food was decent, the rice was terrible and the attitude of the cashier was not what I expected with a $65 food order!!I wouldn't go back for that price and food quality but perhaps we caught them on a bad day.."	jQsNFOzDpxPmOurSWCg1vQ	2	2013-05-23	0	0

We ordered the Asian Chicken Salad, chicken was old and had that old gross fridge taste.. Dan Dan Noodle, the noodles were over cooked and stuck together as one large soggy noodle.. Curry with Tofu, the curry had a weird perfume taste.. the honey chicken was pretty good as well as the hot and sour soup though neither made for good leftovers.

1	GG9tAoEC9sMa_DokSkkImA	kAA5n5ie00OFi0w0K53WSA	"Pei Wei is the fast food version of PF Changs. There's a long and interesting story surrounding Pei Wei and that of PF Changs. Let me just say that, a man named Paul Fleming (PF) and (Flemings) is responsible for many of the restaurants that you and I frequent. His ex wife and him went through a bitter divorce her nickname is (Flow) and she operates ""Flows,"" Chinese restaurants. Flow is Chinese and married another Caucasian man 20-25 years younger than her, who speaks fluent Chinese. Anyways, Peiwei's in my opinion is overpriced for the small amount of you receive for the consideration you give. In other words, there's no value for your consideration. Yes, I do enjoy the PeiWei Spicy chicken, extra spicy with water chestnuts, but at $12.53 for the water chestnuts and extra chicken, it's just not worth it. The rice is almost always dry and is cooked incorrectly in massive amounts, as well as being a long grain, not short grain rice. NOT WORTH THE MONEY!!!"	jQsNFOzDpxPmOurSWCg1vQ	3	2017-06-10	5	3

We had the Mongolian Beef and Kung Pao chicken.  The beef was in a salty, sticky sweet brown sauce that rendered it almost inedible.  The Chicken had little spice or sauce, although the pea pods were fresh.  Think Panda Express. Food is not serve family style.

It seems to be subjective, I know. But in comparison to legitimate Asian food, wheather that's credible Thai, Chinese, Vietnamese, etc., I'm not sure how anyone can make a compelling argument that Pei Wei is ""good"" food.. The crab wontons are usually a sure bet at any Asian restaurant but for some reason it just always sucks ass here. Fishy weird taste that's contrary to what they should taste like and the sauce is garbage. Teriyaki Chicken was bland and shitty. Pei Wei Spicy dish was average at best only cuz of the sweet sugary sauce that masks the overall flavor. Now my girlfriend and I just feel like shit.. Why? Cuz it's shitty food. Also saw on the local news that the location on Glendale and 7th st. had 4 health code violations. I'm officially done with this place. Spend a couple extra bucks and go eat some authentic Asian cuisine at a family owned restaurant that actually knows how to cook real food.. Not some corporate food chain bullshit..

The food was okay but the portions were a bit big. While I was waiting for the food (+30 min) I noticed a lot of people just ate a few bites and left the food on the table. So much food wasted- there must be a reason for that right?? The bathrooms weren't clean, barely had soap no towels and toilet didn't even flush!! I hope next time I'm down here that it isn't this bad.	jQsNFOzDpxPmOurSWCg1vQ	2	2015-11-07	0	0

Only two tables were occupied at the time we walked in for a carry out. We walked in and they looked at us like.....really? Go away!! Someone walked up to the register and he just looked at me. I asked him if he was ready to take my order and he just kept looking at me like I was wasting his time.  No thank you, nothing. Just a hand to take my money and then a bag in my face so I would leave and get out of their faces. Really???	jQsNFOzDpxPmOurSWCg1vQ	1	2014-10-27	0	0

First I was unable to order online,   when I  went to pick up the food I brought  a gift card with a remaining credit on it and the remaining total written on top with a permanent marker which would have covered the entire cost of my meal. When I handed it over to the employee  she swiped the card and simply stated there is a zero balance on this card. To which I replied that can't be correct because the last time I used it the employee wrote the available balance on the top of the card for me. The cashier didn't seem to take me serious and simply asked for another method of payment. I was in a rush it was my lunch hour so  I paid out of pocket. The sauce on my food taste watered down over all a poor experience. To add insult to injury I later called the number on my gift card and they assured me that I did have a credit balance which leave's me wondering what are gift card's good for?

We were the only patrons in the restaurant and the waiter seemed  inconvenienced by us being there. After he took our order he went and sat down in another booth and started playing on a computer. We did not get our food quickly like everyone else has said, as we were the only people here it shouldn't take as long as it takes for me to finish my beverage. Maybe it had something to do with the fact that the waiter was farting around instead of doing his job? They got three stars because despite the service the food was AMAZING and quite inexpensive. If you order a quesadilla you may want to order a la carte items as well because the quesadilla was the size of a large Taco which is odd.	dwQEZBFen2GdihLLfWeexA	3	2011-06-14	0	0

We were greeted promptly and brought to our table.  The chips were fresh and warm.  The salsa was a little blander than we care for.  Service seemed slow, but in all fairness it was Saturday evening.  I ordered the Lobster Enchiladas which had pieces of lobster sautéed with onion and tomato wrapped in a fresh corn tortilla.  It was average.  My husband had the Burrito Especial with a chicken burrito and a beef tip burrito.  Hubby said it was above average.  The rice had a nice flavor with an aftertaste of tomato and cilantro.  We were disappointed with the lack of complex flavor profiles that we have become accustomed to while living in the Southwest.  Overall, we rated it as adequate to good.	dwQEZBFen2GdihLLfWeexA	3	2015-09-13	0	0

0	9CiRp71NmS_AP74rW-1gdg	6sX7YcBhK0ASD8kLdVdCnw	First time I eat here I came with friends who told me the food was the most authentic Mexican food they ever had, well it was not for me since it's not really Mexican but Tex Mex really. It wasn't bad but nothing to write home about either, I ordered a piña colada and the waiter spill it over me without replacing it not good at all, the place tries so hard to be unique and as Mexican as can be but it is just a caricature and a stereotype of anything Mexican honestly I was waiting for the three amigos to come out of the bathroom or something I despise decoration like this  and it affected the overall rating. Second time there food was not as good I ordered a dish that included carnitas in it but they were missing I told my waiter he apologized brought them in told me he was sorry but he charged me for them anyways even though they were supposed to be included. Not as bad as others but not great by any means.	dwQEZBFen2GdihLLfWeexA	3	2010-03-29	1	0

0	vikyvfRREkyvIFg1wtxk1g	LWsWwahRBEPbmiSlrwA31g	The first thing I noticed here was the decor, which I have to say I liked.  Of course, yes, I enjoy lime green walls and bright pink color washes, but that's just me.  We had three little ones with us, so you can imagine that we were a little less than organized, but our server took it all in stride, which we appreciated.  He was also super fast; I think all of us were surprised how quickly our meals came out. As for the food, I feel like it's a little difficult to review.  I had never been here before and my Mexican palate is less-than-sophisticated, so I randomly ordered a plain enchilada and quesadilla.  The latter was pretty good, though I found the enchilada a little perplexing.  It was hiding under the sauce and I couldn't really tell what was in it.    The chips and salsa were great, though.  And hot.  The one person at our table who can apparently drink tabasco sauce straight even admitted his eyes were watering a little.  Everyone else seemed to really enjoy their meals.  I'm not in Ohio much, but I'd happily go back and try something else.  Oh, and um, I wouldn't exactly object to painting my living room lime green, after seeing how cool it looked at Don's.	dwQEZBFen2GdihLLfWeexA	3	2010-05-18	1	0

We both ordered off the specials menu, and my husband barely managed to squeeze in his standard 'where's my burrito' before two large plates, overflowing with food, arrived in front of us.The food itself was good. Mexican food can too easily be greasy, but this was not. The menu is nothing startling, but the classic mexican dishes were all on the mark. And there was enough left over for a second meal tomorrow.Prices were very reasonable - our total bill, including tips, was less than $25.

I didn't take notes - too busy enjoying the company - but I'm pretty sure I got a burrito and it was delicious.  Margaritas were excellent (this much I do remember) and service was quick and pleasant.

I was at don tequila yesterday & the cashier was talking  to me but I couldn't understand so I laughed it off.     He told me I looked sexy today and said something else. I said thanks and laughed so that he wouldn't be offended. He came around the counter and walked up on me then hugged me so I assume he was asking for a hug.     He then whispered in my ear that he just wanted to feel my breast on his chest. Seriously....I don't feel like I need to wear jeans and sweaters in the summer because he is a pervert.

The neon sign beckons you inside and once there, sit back and enjoy.The roomy booths offer space for cozy dinner or enough room for your whole brood or gang of friends. Nibble some fresh chips and salsa while you ponder your meal options. The salsa is fresh with tomatoes, cilantro and spice. In case that isn't enough heat for you ask for the special sauce from the kitchen for extra kick and spice.I ordered the chili rellenos hoping not to be disappointed - this gal spent some time in Arizona and loves her Mexican food. These didn't disappoint. Yum. Served with rice and beans with a drizzle of red sauce.Good enough to want to return and sample through the menu -- several other items caught my eye - fish tacos, nightly specials, burritos with tomatillo sauce!!! The staff is friendly and patiently gives you time to check-out the menu and answer any questions. nom.nom.	dwQEZBFen2GdihLLfWeexA	3	2014-04-04	0	0

You get your chips and salsa as you sit down as usual while they take orders for drinks.  They got horchata here now, which is a + in my book, if you haven't tried it yet, i totally recommend to.  The food came out rather fast and speedy on extremely hot plates.  The salsa and hot sauces there are bombbbbb. Ask them for homemade style hot sauces they make in the kitchen, it's different everytime you go in.  Some will leave you sweating and some will leave a sweet or an extra tomato flavor in your mouth.The food i'd definitely rate 7.5/10. as i'm a hardcore mexican food lover.  It's nothing you find in texas or california, but quite damn close.  I always find myself coming back to this fun filled, warm, family owned place and always leave feeling satisfied.  for taqueria style tacos, try the tacos el pastor!	dwQEZBFen2GdihLLfWeexA	4	2012-11-26	0	1

Seated immediately, the waiter came to the table immediately, and the food came almost immediately after we'd ordered. Boyfriend got a combo platter with an enchilada and taquito and devoured the whole thing. I got a carnitas dinner platter and I could only finish half since I filled up on chips and salsa and guacamole. It was so good! The only disappointing part was the dessert. We ordered flan, and when it arrived it was covered in whipped cream and strawberry sauce which I am not a fan of. The consistency was nubbly. Should've went with the churros.	dwQEZBFen2GdihLLfWeexA	4	2010-08-18	1	1
0	-S1dz92Q3RPfHomiqEeP8Q	0yqWd0USYSpaPI7zUW4JAw	Passed this place a few times and finally decided to try it. I got the #17 on the lunch menu. It was a burrito  with eggs, chorizo and cheese.  It was probably one of the most tasteless burritos I've ever had. It was covered in what appeared to be some sort of franks red hot sauce, and no im not mistaking it for enchilada sauce. The side of my plate was a pile of tomatoes shredded cheese and a piece of lettuce, a whole piece not shredded. Not happy with my lunch at all. The salsa and cheese dip were average, nothing to go crazy over. Service was quick and friendly. The food came out about 5 minutes after we ordered which kinda scared me. I like quick service, but also don't mind waiting a few minutes for some really good food. Overall the place was cute, people were friendly but food was less than OK. I wouldn't go back.	dwQEZBFen2GdihLLfWeexA	1	2011-10-28	0	0

Went there because they had catered a party of a friend of mine.Our server was professional, and bilingual.  But you could totally understand him and had a cool accent.  Americanized i suppose.  They do not use a POS system but use an old paper check system...so separate checks becomes an issue.They put tons of chips and salsa in front of you...the chips are super crunch but almost no salt, and the salsa was bland for my taste.I had the el paso speciai; beef tip burrito and chicken burrito w/ rice and beans.  All came out hot but a little watery.  Dunno where that came from.  But I did ask for lettuce/tomato set as it did not come with any in or on it.Kids food came out fast, they did have the world cup and that seemed to distract the waiters...but as far as Mexican food goes it was pretty good for Mentor.	dwQEZBFen2GdihLLfWeexA	4	2014-06-25	0	0

We felt like we were part of la familia. I haven't felt that way in a Mexican restaurant, probably ever.  Fajitas did not arrive sizzling. Bummer.  My bean burrito and cheese enchilada were standard fare. Nothing to shout about. The beer was extra cold so bueno for that.  Very clean restaurant.	dwQEZBFen2GdihLLfWeexA	3	2017-07-04	1	0

Some things good somethings not so great but on the whole in between.The room is simple, farmhouse chic: long harvest table, ornamental roosters and wooden chairs with cushions for seating. Sundays and Mondays they have a decent prix fix menu on offer or you can order a la carte from their shared plates menu. I went with the steak frites and salad off the table d'hote. Spinach salad came nicely dressed though the dressing was plain could have used more tartness. I had a few slight issues with the steak frites, the steak came closer to medium when medium rare was requested and was under seasoned. My accompaniment of frites (which were wonderful btw) on the other hand was too liberally salted with kosher salt so I guess I got the best of both worlds! The Bearnaise sauce sauce on the side was so-so and didn't do too much to perk up the steak. Dessert was chilled rhubarb with creme anglaise really lovely but too much sugar in the sauce and the sprig of thyme thrown in kinda messed with my tastebuds, I really should have plucked it out!My server was a lovely affable gentlemen who was very friendly, warm and quick on his toes. I did like the service. But the food was so-so and I find that there are better bistro options around town.	mr4FiPaXTWlJ3qGzp4-7Yg	3	2009-07-21	3	0

(one thing has nothing to do with the other should you be saying to yourself something along the lines of ""well then what the hell is he complaining about"").the vegetables that came on separate plates alongside the sandwiches were  4 dollars each.  we had three kinds.  one was sweet potatoes dressed with chilies, toasted coriander, mint and olive oil.  another was called farro, an ancient tuscan grain dressed with extra virgin olive oil, cucumber, carrot, and fine herbs. and the last one was chickpea salad with celery, pickled red onions, rosemary, parsley and lemon.i enjoyed all of them, but they were honestly not representative of their ingredients.  i dont need to have my dishes overpowered by their listed ingredients, but if something says its going to be flavoured by mint, fine herbs and lemon dont you think you should be able to experience that as you taste it?  i think so.  again, to reiterate, i didnt mind the natural taste of the vegetable offered, but if thats the way it will end up tasting, perhaps you should say so.all my peeves aside, i am still interested in trying this place out for dinner; the feel of the place is great, cool and relaxing and as i looked at their dinner menu it looked quite tasty.  so perhaps once they get their groove on itll be more enjoyable."	mr4FiPaXTWlJ3qGzp4-7Yg	3	2008-12-13	1	0

The food is really really good. They have a great cocktail list. We shared the hot balls (delicious) and the rillettes (I loved it). Then, I had the beef tartare with the side of potatoes cooked in duck fat (awesome). To finish, I had the lemon pannacotta...this is by far one of the best dessert I've tried. I am not a dessert person and not a big fan of lemon but that dessert was just perfect!! The service was slow so don't go there if you are in a rush! Our waiter was really nice  and even tried to speak in French as he noticed that we were speaking French. I will definitely go back there...I am sad this place is kind of far from were I live!	mr4FiPaXTWlJ3qGzp4-7Yg	5	2013-10-12	1	1
0	3hLMY2dBEP1kYbd_ywTsCQ	oviMS8F4ACflGysxsXKmew	Had a lovely evening last night at Table 17.  Great selection of wine and the owner made an excellent suggestion of something we had never heard of before - bearing in mind both price point, meal choices and preferences (though overall it was a bit of a pricey list, only one bottle south of $50, just).  Lovely, vibrant atmosphere, the polenta was delicious as a starter (the chef tops it with a different finish every day - last night it was meatballs) - though the other ones we saw at other tables also looked sumptuous - and our meals/sides were excellent.  Also, the food pricesAll in all a great evening  - could have happily ordered anything from the menu, and what we did order was delish.   Definitely will go back to work our way through the rest of the menu.	mr4FiPaXTWlJ3qGzp4-7Yg	5	2013-02-17	0	0

Dinner: have been numerous times have tried their salumi & cheese board ($15) with was good, not Black Hoof excellent, but still pretty good. Their steak frites ($21) consisting of an 8 oz top cut sirloin was cooked perfecting medium rare and served with a side of beranaise sauce. decadent and good. Have also had lamb here but it must have been a special because it does not appear on the menu.Brunch: You need to order a side of their thick cut double smoked bacon. Its to die for. They also typically have cinnamon buns at brunch that are baked in house. My favourite brunch item on the menu has to be Farmer's breakfast with consists of a scotch egg (soft boiled, battered then deep fried egg), a terrine with toast and a small side salad. Surprisingly it doesn't look like its on the menu anymore :( Have also had the stewed eggs which was also good.Note: If you are a member of Foursquare, check out their specials for check-ins, last time i was there for brunch you got a mimosa or caesar on the house with you check-ins.	mr4FiPaXTWlJ3qGzp4-7Yg	3	2011-08-14	1	0

Booking was incredibly easy and they took care of everything professionally and quickly. We were even able to come in the night before and decorate.The dinner was amazing. We had the family style menu, which included: kale citrus salad, buffalo mozzarella, hunters mash, green beans, polenta with lamb bolognese, braised lamb shank, short ribs... There was more, but you get it. Lots of food for every one, lots to choose from, and so amazingly delicious. Everyone stopped talking at one point, they we're too busy eating.We had a cake of our own brought in, so we got to take the dessert from the menu home. It was amazing, so decadent.It was a fantastic dinner at the end of a fantastic day. I don't think I could have picked a better place to host my wedding meal.My favourite was the polenta bolognese.

1	Jyi0WJt0UfGdEg0grR38ZA	UbL9dgEYA7PeL-47W6m3KA	"I wasn't super impressed but I also wasn't really turned off, I guess my experience was mediocre with a little disappointment. The restaurant in itself is very down to earth with only a slight hint of class. The host and the servers are not snobby and seem fairly friendly in this Leslieville establishment. The patrons are mixed with both young and hip city dwellers along with older more experienced foodies dining out with other couples of the same.I found myself here ordering the much touted ""Hot Balls"" but found it just okay. The only hot ball that really stood out was the Goat Cheese with a honey like dipping sauce. It was actually a pretty amazing piece of creation. The other appetizer we have were the ""Diver Scallops"" which were cooked to perfection and came with a side of really thick and salty bacon. Our mains were the ""Leg of Lamb"" and ""Wild Stripped Bass"" both were great entrees that did not disappoint but at the same time didn't have a great WOW factor.  Desert was a bit of a disappointment, not much of a variety, you had a choice between chocolate, chocolate, or chocolate in some form or another. We had the homemade chocolate cheesecake, which really didn't amount to much for my taste buds. The Wine list is very French and if you're going by the bottle they don't really have an inexpensive alternative. Every bottle is $50+ which can make for a very expensive meal. Overall the food experience was just okay with some ups and downs. But the real down of the night was the service, after sitting down to our table , it took literally 10 min for someone to show up to greet us and take our drink orders. The other downside of the service, they don't place the wine bottles at your table but at a communal table in the centre of the room, they're suppose to pour for you but I found that our server kept forgetting even when our wine glasses were empty. I had to reach over to this communal table to grab our own bottle of wine and pour every time which really kills the experience.I hope this was just an isolated experience for us as I think this restaurant is a real gem in the Leslieville area. If you do decide to go, make sure you have reservations as the restaurant seems to get filled up in all hours of the night."	mr4FiPaXTWlJ3qGzp4-7Yg	3	2010-06-07	3	1

We had reservations but had to wait at the bar (no big deal) and the bartender (he's in his early 100s) was a riot.I had the polenta to start. It was creamy and buttery, and the braised pork shoulder in white wine on top was oh-so-good.I had the short ribs as my main. The meat was tender and moist and the root veggies were perfectly cooked.We shared the hunters mash as a side - I was expecting more flavour.Table 17 had a great vibe to it.The food was good.

It was terrible service, and I was very surprised to see this. The waitress asked us to order our appetizer and entree at the same time, causing us to feel very rushed. We waited about an hour for our dinner and were quite disinterested when the food even came.  The beef tartar was by far my best course. The scallops were fine, as to be expected. The broccoli Was good once you were able to get past that it was cold. Wine list by the glass was limited, and we never heard of any specials for the evening. We did receive bread with oil prior to the meal, but no extra plate to put the oil on. We had to get up ourselves and go to the bread table for a plate, balsamic vinegar, salt and pepper.

The place is simple but beautiful - gorgeous reclaimed wood, candlelit tables and lush fabrics. It just feels good when you walk in. The staff on both visits were very friendly and attentive, and both times the meals were excellent. Their prix fixe meal is tremendous value for the quality of the food you get although just a heads up that some of the dishes are very rich, so go easy on the apps! (re: get yourself a nice salad if you order the short ribs or risotto). If you're feeling like a cocktail to start the meal (and who wouldn't?) I'd suggest the Bourbon sour.

Our group started off with the polenta special, a strong recommendation from the friends that suggested Table 17. As I understand it, the polenta to start rotates nightly... maybe weekly? This particular night it was served with some seasoned pork and Parmesan cheese. Thumbs way up for the polenta, the pork on the other hand... eh. Didn't have a tremendous amount of flavor. But no worries. Our entrees were bomb. Fish, filet, sides I don't think you can go wrong, and I highly suggest grabbing things everyone will like because you'll want to start forking at your neighbor's!

Love the décor.They have a gigantic table in the center of the restaurant where they slice your bread.  Kinda cool, but it takes up a lot of useful real estate.  Another 2 or 3 tables could potentially be in it's place.The ""hot balls"" were highly recommended by a friend so we just had to order them.  I can't say I've ever had anything like them before.  There are 3 different types:  Arancino - mushroom & Fontina stuffed risotto, Goat cheese - wildflower honey, and Arancino - spiced lamb stuffed risotto.  A little expensive for the size of these things, but delicious.I went with the fish (trout) for my entrée.  It was very good.

Maybe it was an off night but I walked away with a bad first impression. So did my guests.The dinner reservation was at 5:45 on a Saturday, so it wasn't like it was packed. Still took close to 40 mins until our cocktails arrived. Our server was very pleasant but the service steadily declined over the course of our 3 hour (!!!) meal. Scatterbrained service, slow bartender and even slower kitchen. It was clear the kitchen and bar were completely backed up. Our table was finished our bottle of wine before our mains arrived so I ordered another glass of wine so I could enjoy some with dinner. That glass arrived 20 mins after I was finished my main. Lots of apologies but little else.That being said, the cocktails, hot balls and panna cotta were outstanding. And the space is gorgeous. However, our mains were overpriced and overcooked. We all cleaned our plates because we were starving (almost 2 hours to receive mains), but they just weren't great. The Halibut was the best of the bunch.Considering the amount of solid restaurants in this city, I won't visit again.	mr4FiPaXTWlJ3qGzp4-7Yg	2	2013-10-07	1	0

The scallops were fantastic, some of the best I have had here in Toronto. I am usually not a big béarnaise fan, but found myself scraping the plate. The guanciale was a neat change too (different style of bacon).Had the pork tenderloin wrapped in pancetta for dinner, also fantastic. Well cooked and presented. Love the square plates.My friend had the braised short ribs, but was mildly disappointed. Found them to be very chewy. She made up for it with chamomile grappa for dessert.The cheese plate for dessert, was a LOT of cheese! Good size hunks of Ontario Swiss, Ontario 10 year cheddar, a blue (im not a blue fan, so didnt pay attention), a something else that was kinda gouda-esque, and wonderful creamy goat cheese. Plus bread, crackers, olives, honey and apricot jam. Massive. Took a piece of cheese with me to the car!My friend had the chocolate trio. She didnt like the darjeeling sauce on the chocolate, so that kinda disappointed dessert.All in all, i thought it was quite good, but rare occurrence in Toronto where i had a fantastic meal, but my dinner date's was ho-hum. We agreed though that we'd give it another chance based on the scallops alone.The service we had was fine, gentleman with a bit of a british accent was quite good and knowledgeable.

The place is cozy and inviting. It's nice enough for a romantic dinner (NB: Sunday and Monday nights they have a $32 three-course table d'hote, and bring your own wine) but relaxed enough for families with young kids. The chicken theme (in the logo, decor) reminded me of the old Bistro Bakery Thuet. The brunch menu changes seasonally, so the current offerings are different from the menu on the website. I had the scrambled eggs -- smooth and fluffy with pecorino cheese and mixed peppers. It came with a green salad and warm baguette. It was filling without being too heavy or greasy. My DC had the Farmer's Breakfast, with a hard boiled egg in this deep fried batter, with an assortment of Ontario and Quebec cheeses (including a yummy Brie), pate, and tiny pickles. We shared an order of rosti, which was just right -- crisp and hearty. It's chunkier than the rosti at Le Petit Dejeuner, but not as thick as the rosti at Richtree/Movenpick. For drinks, I just had a glass of the freshly squeezed OJ. They do have $5 mimosas and caesars. DC had coffee, which was refilled diligently. The whole meal for 2 people came to $40 including tax and tip. Pretty reasonable for a nice place and great food. Service was friendly and attentive. Street parking on weekends is usually easy to find and $1.50 per hour. I checked-in and unlocked and offer for $36 for a ""14 oz. (!!)

Service was great, food was fantastic, and as a nice surprise we didn't have to wait all that long for a table.  And a good brunch can't just rely on its food for good reviews, so the answer is yes, the Ceasars were awesome.  We don't really live in the area but our visit here was really good so we'll be back.	mr4FiPaXTWlJ3qGzp4-7Yg	4	2012-08-21	0	0

We were seated by the bar area close to the entrance. They have huge windows which are nice but get in your eyes in the day so we asked the servers to bring down the shades. Service was decent but not the best since the restaurant was pretty full and they only had two servers. The brunch menu is pretty diverse and goes beyond the typical french toast, pancakes, scrambled eggs  with sausage/bacon/ham & hash browns deal. I had The Sloppy Guisseppe, which is a plate of a couple fried eggs over bolognese sauce and fried polenta and fresh greens with a vinaigrette dressing.  The bolognese sauce was really meaty and thick - delicious and paired with fried eggs, you just can't go wrong. The fried polenta didn't seem ""fried"" as it wasn't crispy; not even around the edges which made the dish mushy...but then again, that's probably why it's called the ""Sloppy"" Guisseppe. I would have preferred if I had at least toasted bread on the side for a crunch or simply just a different texture (the salad wasn't enough). My sisters had the Pain Dore, which is french toast with cinnamon creme anglaise & berries. They liked it and thought the creme anglaise was a nice alternative to maple syrup."	mr4FiPaXTWlJ3qGzp4-7Yg	3	2011-02-27	0	0
0	FYAkhIj29gyWD_Lte1v7SQ	eAZDknO3E_za9AIGZjIDAA	Had a very lovely meal here on Saturday. Came at 6:30 and it wasn't busy but filled up by the time we left. The crowd was definitely older, I don't think I saw anyone under 30 in there. Decor was very woodsy and rustic. But at the end of the day, it's the food that counts!We had...Hot balls: lamb risotto, mushroom and fontina risotto, and a goat cheese and honey balls. You get three little timbit sized balls for 7 bucks which I thought was very reasonable. They were so delicious, I wished we had gotten the double portion after we were finished.Polenta w/ Sausage Sugo: My affection for polenta knows no bounds so I loved every little spoonful of this. It came out on a slice of a tree trunk which allowed the polenta to slowly spread out perfectly over the dish. Polenta was creamy and had a nice umami flavour. Good liquid-to-polenta ratio made this comforting and incredibly addictive. Chef came out and laid the hot sausage meat sauce right on top of it. We loved it so much, we made it at home the next day...seriously.Steak tartare w/ frites and salad: Delish and flavourful tartare. The frites were incredible!! Get them!Will I be back? Yes! None of the dishes even remotely disappointed me and the service was solid.	mr4FiPaXTWlJ3qGzp4-7Yg	5	2013-09-30	0	0

I've all but given up on Toronto until finding this gem through a friend in New York who raved about it. Took my vegetarian children for dinner, and we had an absolutely outstanding experience. Everything from the friendly and funny staff, to the custom vegetarian dinner that the teens devoured, was spectacular. The highlights: Hot balls, Brussel Sprouts, Diver scallops, Tartare, and the pasta was so light and tender with incredible delicate flavorsKudos.We'll be back soon!	mr4FiPaXTWlJ3qGzp4-7Yg	5	2011-06-15	0	0
1	DuoBTfKNM67965BcrlYBYg	elb_JjGey_SGKUyo91c8hA	The first time I came to Table 17 was a little over a year ago. I took my grandmother and my aunt out for dinner. The moment I came to this place I was very impressed. Firstly, it was very conveniently located to us. Secondly, it has this very home-y feel and decor. Nothing felt overwhelming. We came on a Monday night. (To my knowledge Sunday and Monday nights Table17 offers prix fixe menu.) We all ordered different staters, steak and different desserts! However, what made me fall in love with this place is thee amazing home made olive oil. Their olive oil tasted amazingly fresh and you can't help but eat all of their fresh bread with it. Unfortunately, in multiple occasions I've asked if I could purchase a bottle and to my disappointment they do not sell their olive oil. :( The only thing I found about this place that did not satisfy my expectations were tht the servers are very slow and not as hospitable as other servers from my other experiences. Overall, I definitely recommend this place. Especially their duck confit which is amazing! -CL PS they take reservations and it gets pretty busy so be sure to make them. :)	mr4FiPaXTWlJ3qGzp4-7Yg	4	2013-11-15	1	1

Benefit of the doubt moment: it was after 8 pm on a Sunday -- which in Toronto means you're lucky if anything half-decent is open at all -- and the place seemed  understaffed. Still, having to stand awkwardly for 10-15 min in the non-foyer, while  waiters whisked by us was not too pleasant.And once we had a table, service continued to be spotty. Our waiter was friendly and self-effacing, calling us his ""little neglected table."" This was not inaccurate as even getting our initially requested waters (it was sweaty out!) took nearly 10 minutes, and later he left us with dessert menus for 20 minutes before coming back to see what we wanted, our appetites for anything sweet having seriously waned.Food-wise though, things were great. We weren't terribly hungry, and so avoided the table d'hote fixed price menu going with the ""shared food"" section on the left column of the menu. It's a limited selection here, and we ordered about half of the available items, and were not disappointed. Rich white polenta, brought out on a wooden cutting board was accompanied by an aproned chef who ladled a ""sugo"" of veal, zucchini and fresh basil on top. It was heart-warming, subtle and delicious, as well as a generous portion for two to share.Alongside the polenta we had two smallish ramekins. One contained ""sauce & balls"" a cheekily named but very tasty take on classic meatballs in tomato sauce. The other had what was possibly my favourite dish of the night, a simple roasted beet preparation with blue cheese. The multicoloured heirloom beets were ""al dente"" but tender and went amazingly well with the semi-melted cheese.Wines were great as well. My glass of Rollegrosse red ($11) was smooth beyond even the menu description, and my companion's ""Anna 6"" white was very dry and very refreshing. In addition to the service problems, my one other issue was the post-prandial whiskey, a single malt ($13) that came in a far-too large glass (we were informed the kitchen was ""out"" of snifters...) and which I found harsh and not to my liking. But that could be a matter of taste.Total cost of meal for two: $77 + tip.This would increase to over $100 easily if you go with the $30 table d'hote option + drinks.I would happily give this place another shot, hopefully on day where service was at full steam. Until then I can't give it more than three stars out of five."	mr4FiPaXTWlJ3qGzp4-7Yg	3	2009-08-10	3	0

You could tell it had been prepared with great care and came out piping hot.The service was also fantastic. The server was extremely helpful in selecting a wine, and providing recommendations on the menu. We didn't feel pressured at all during the meal to hurry up or order more AKA increase the bill amount.THE BOTTOM LINE: wonderful food, and equally as wonderful service.	mr4FiPaXTWlJ3qGzp4-7Yg	5	2015-04-15	1	2

I can't remember his name, unfortunately. He made excellent suggestions, was very helpful, knew all the dishes, and the ingredients.We had the Beef Carpaccio and Squid Ceviche in Gozpacho to start and were blown away by both! My wife was really looking forward to the lamb shank, which was not on that days' menu, so our server suggested the Venison loin. My wife had never had venison, so it took a little convincing, but she loved it.  It was probably the best venison I've ever tasted. I had the polenta with the wild boar sugo. very good. We also ordered the Roasted Jerusalem Artichokes, which were fantastic. The wine was very good, and dessert was excellent, Maple Panna Cotta and Sticky Toffee Pudding. All in all an excellent dining experience.	mr4FiPaXTWlJ3qGzp4-7Yg	5	2015-01-27	0	0

Can't complain about a thing here. Even their bathrooms are sparkly clean. Heard They're moving to another location soon or renovating. Better call ahead and ask. Duck confit and their pasta in beurre sauce is mind blowing. Worth a try If you're in the area. Something different for date night.	mr4FiPaXTWlJ3qGzp4-7Yg	5	2015-06-17	0	0
0	J3ucveGKKJDvtuCNnb_x0g	K2BYOl6veq4_aykdrDqSYw	We were back here this evening.  Delish!I ordered the beef tartare - it was pretty tasty, large enough to share as beef tartare is both an acquired taste and fairly rich on it's own.  My main was the leg of lamb, it was a little well done for my liking, but the flavour was quite nice - the morel mushrooms were loaded with a burst of buttery flavour.  My bf started with scallops, they were quite large for scallops, and quite nice, and had a white fish, not trout, maybe halibut, that was also quite delish.  I love the decor, and upon reading other reviews am super sad that I missed out on a group on!  It was wonderful anyway, and I think a great place to dine.  We went for an early seating (a bit before 6), and I'm happy to report, that next time, I'll either go for another early seating or something later (after 9 in the evening), as it can get quite loud, and that makes it hard to hear your dining companion!	mr4FiPaXTWlJ3qGzp4-7Yg	4	2012-07-08	1	1

Dinner for 4 - with a healthy amount of food (or unhealthy - depends on how you look at it).The polenta had their ""reindeer sauce"" which consisted of venison, spices, and berries. Delicious. Oysters were tasty, and the braised pork was unbelievably good. No idea what they used for aromatics - but there was a hint of fennel that was incredible. $400 for 4 people and drinks. Not a value dinner, but enjoyable, and guarantees my return. Oh. Peanut Butter Panna Cotta. Order it and thank me later. Servers were hilarious, attentive, and accommodating. I just can't see anything wrong with this place."	mr4FiPaXTWlJ3qGzp4-7Yg	5	2014-01-15	0	0
0	LRKmxCcf6ZkxyujPdmp5zQ	0IeuJHDMwJxHPMMs-Bt0BA	I left Table 17 as pleased as could be last weekend- indulging in the very reasonably priced Sunday night table d'hôte we enjoyed the scallops, salted cod, polenta, boar sausage, panna cotta and gingerbread cookies with eggnog (!) We were particularly wowed by the boar but the entire meal was fabulous.As a big bonus the place is BYOB with no corkage fees for one or two bottles.A couple other reviewers noted a lack of attentiveness on the part of the servers- I would contend that our experience was the complete opposite of this. The server was charming, present and exceedingly helpful. Maybe this can be racked up to visiting on an early December Sunday evening? In any case, it was exactly what I was hoping for and more.	mr4FiPaXTWlJ3qGzp4-7Yg	5	2014-12-28	0	0

I too had a $50 Groupon here and was really excited to give it a try. At first I was concerned that this place may be too fancy and romantic for a casual dinner with a friend, but the other patrons made that problem go away fast! Picture It's 9pm and you are trying to enjoy your meal next to four tables of three super loud middle-aged women who are all gossipping and complaining about their ""first-world problems"": She only got a 1.5 karat ring... I hate it when my maid doesn't iron the cuff on my pants... blah blah blah. I honestly wanted to tell them to all shut up. This is by no means the restaurant's fault but killed the ambiance for sure.The food itself was good but the portions are quite small. I also found the menu selection to be minimal with only 6 entrees to choose from including a super tasty but super small bowl of pasta with wild mushrooms for $18.I found the service friendly but very slow and inattentive.

2	Oxe8DXjBOi6C-cR2w64zOg	1goCEpy95A_Vxyo-IT1Yag	"Is the food at Table 17 excellent? Yes.Is that enough for me to give it five stars? No.I've been twice, once for dinner and once for brunch. On both occasions my meals were delicious, fresh and expertly prepared and presented. Wine and coffee top notch also! Yet, I still left hungry, and somewhat frustrated.Why? The portion sizes at Table 17 are just too small, even for the average appetite. Add in frankly exorbitant costs, and it becomes clear that this place just ... well, just could be so much better. My French toast for brunch was served with about five berries -not even a salad - and must have amounted to about three slices of bread in total. $10 before tax.The dinner menu was infuriating in its unnecessary pretentiousness. It took me about five readings of the menu to actually understand what was on offer. Less of the fancy culinary jargon and arbitrary French/Italian synonyms for basic food items, please. My chicken mushroom tagliatelle was flawless as it was - was there really any need to describe it as ""Hen of the woods (is that the new word for chicken?!) hedgehog mushrooms, with tarragon beurre fondue""?! Again I must reiterate the pricing. Two mains, one shared side and a glass of wine came to $70. Thankfully, the friendly service and general lively ambiance is spared the unnecessary pretensions of the menu. And if the food continues to be mouth-wateringly delicious (and trust me, it is), then I can't see why I wouldn't return to Table 17, for a special occasion. This restaurant could be a true five-star establishment, if only it had bigger portions and a more down-to-earth, straightforward menu, that would allow the world-class food to speak for itself."	mr4FiPaXTWlJ3qGzp4-7Yg	4	2014-06-01	1	1

I highly suggest going around 11:30 as you just miss the 12pm rush.  It is a stylish restaurant and the service was top notch.For my meal, I had the french toast.  It was good - light and perfectly cooked.  The cinnamon anglaise tasted like melted ice cream.  There was an assortment of berries as well.  Their orange juice was freshly squeezed and we were in and out in under 45 minutes. Definitely will be back for another brunch extrodinaire!	mr4FiPaXTWlJ3qGzp4-7Yg	4	2013-04-10	0	0

First off the ""hot balls"" ( I know, I know), were phenomenal: arancini stuffed with risotto, another with goat cheese, and finally the crab. Each came with their own dipping sauce: amaaazing.For dinner, the lamb tenderloin with a parsnip puree was cooked to perfection, a friend ordered the steak frites (delish), the beef tartare was tender and spicy and you can't really go wrong with an arugula salad, which was fresh and tasty. The presentation of the halibut wrapped in ramps (mild leek), was a show-stopper (as was the pomegranate mojito). Great place for a date, for a nice celebration, or just a nice culinary experience."	mr4FiPaXTWlJ3qGzp4-7Yg	5	2009-06-06	1	1

0	g5wYoa19wv1X0UOYVX1IlA	pTq1ez9s0SNxaSlSxLBGGg	Bottom line: great food, cute place, fabulous dinner. Would definitely go again. On the pricier side for the neighbourhood, but nothing ridiculous. Remember to make a reservation.Went to Table 17 for dinner last night. My dinner date and I stupidly didn't think to make a reservation at 7:15 on a Saturday night (dumb, I know). So I definitely recommend a reservation. He had been to Table 17 before, I had not. Of course there were no tables when we arrived, but the staff were more than happy to seat us at the bar, which was thankfully empty when we arrived. Usually not a fan of having a nice dinner at the bar, but the barman managed to do a good job of staying out of our face, but being attentive at the same time. Of course the seat wasn't the comfiest, but that was our fault.Food:The server/ bartender made sure we knew all the daily specials and even recommended a few and took our drink orders (just beer). He also brought us a basket of bread, though it almost wasn't necessary because our appetizer came quickly.To start we shared a Buffalo Mozzarella salad (arugula) with spiced pumpkin puree and honeycomb - yum! My date wasn't too sure about the honey at first, but actually really liked it, was a nice flavour with the mozzarella. The warm pumpkin  with the cheese was my fave part - so delish. For my main I chose the pasta. It was capellini (I think, can't quite recall)...with gorgonzola cheese, roasted hazelnuts and I'm sure I'm forgetting a few ingredients. It was awesome - great mix of flavours and the pasta was cooked perfectly and served hot. I was skeptical about the hazelnuts at first but they were a great compliment to the gorgonzola. The portion was pretty big for this type of place, so my date had a bit of my pasta too and he also thought it was yum.My date had the beef short ribs and said they were excellent and that the meat was falling off the bone. (As someone who does not eat beef or pork I was assured this was a good thing ha). It came with root vegetables and parsnip puree. Just as we were digging in our server brought a little bowl with extra root vegetables because the chef had suddenly realized my date didn't get enough. Once he pointed it out we realized there were only like 3 mini veggie cubes in his dish so it was nice that the staff noticed before we even did. We contemplated getting dessert for a minute, but were pretty stuffed. Maybe next time I'd skip the appetizer and try a dessert.Only main downfall was sitting at the bar, it's not the comfiest to sit on a stool and it felt a bit crowded when other patrons were seated at the bar. It was also a little chilly/breezy as it's near the door and it was cold out. But that was our own fault.Not sure what the total bill was in the end for the 2 drinks, appetizer and two mains, but our mains were around $20-25, some on the menu were a little pricier.Overall great food, good service, cute place, fairly priced (though pricier than some of the other places in the neighbourhood). Definitely recommend.	mr4FiPaXTWlJ3qGzp4-7Yg	4	2012-01-16	1	1

0	y3MNMa0SG_cHC1cwmmntpQ	F7SZgPC5chCn4DItevIJGg	I went here for the brunch the other day in this little bistro-style restaurant in Leslieville and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. The restaurant itself has a really cool decor - very minimal but rustic decor, brown paper tablecloths, quaint, romantic tables and nice, high ceilings. I couldn't get over how much personality the restaurant has, especially considering how new it is. And obviously its age has no affected its popularity. The place was packed at about 1 pm on a saturday. But considering how tasty the food was, I was surprised how busy it was. I ordered a mimosa and the toritilla - a sort of spanish-style dish that takes eggs, potatoes, cheese and bakes it into some quiche-type thing. It was served with a fresh tomato dip and some greens and it was absolutely delicious. I also sampled my boyfriends cheese plater, toasts with a variety of cheese and fruit, and it was also very tasty. Maybe it's because it's new, but the service was the one thing that didn't make this a 5 star occasion. Our waitress was slow, took forever to take our order and then forgot what we wanted. But the food was so good that it didn't ruin the experience.	mr4FiPaXTWlJ3qGzp4-7Yg	4	2008-09-29	1	0

1	HFItzRohDHZvcKDrM6ABZg	650QSmmJ_MaF4WN1V_gFZA	"""Table 17 is the rare restaurant that's both a neighbourhood hangout and a culinary destination,"" is the opening line as you land on their homepage, a quote from Toronto Life from 2013.  That's a tall order to fill and sets the standards high.I wasn't a fan of Table 17 back then and I'm not surprised that my most recent dining experience was no different.  It satisfies the former part of the claim (being a neighbourhood hangout) but is far from being a culinary destination.The kitchen seems to work along at its own pace which errs on the side of slow while servers try their hardest to service the two-roomed restaurant.  While I wouldn't say they're under-staffed I often found myself turning my head in all directions to flag our server down.A meal at Table 17 errs on the side of pricey and while I have had many expensive meals in my lifetime as a food blogger; this one definitely errs on the side of overrated.I've always lived by the mantra that if a restaurant's bread was not up to snuff that it would be an omen of the meal to follow.  Such was the case with the baguette sloppily appearing at our table; one has to ask for the communal balsamic vinegar and olive oil bottles because the servers can't be bothered to offer it.Oysters come with a trio of condiments;  two mignonettes and the standard horseradish.We opt for the halibut ceviche which, with its pretty plating is a disappointment as it turns out to be bland and flavorless.  The saving grace are the pea shoots, flavored with a peanut, chili and lime vinaigrette that is stellar and full-flavored.  I would happily eat a plate full of that as an appetizer.For our mains we settle on an Ontario leg of lamb; which came deboned and served atop a bed of fava beans, roasted spring onion and butter poached black trumpet mushrooms.   Our table of 3 simultaneously shared a single thought - where's the rest of it?  To add insult to injury, the lamb was lukewarm (and the reason was in no way attributed to my occupational hazard of photographing the dish).The Lake Erie pickerel is equally disappointing as we begin to pick at our food by this point.  The radish fennel & grapefruit ""salad"" which to me resembles more of a slaw is bland and lacking oomph.Our dinner suddenly finds salvation in the Spaghetti Al Anatra; its texture loosely reminding me of ramen cooked to a perfect al dente as the duck confit does its magic at flavoring the dish.  The crispy duck skin is a little scant but we happily devour the noodles.Side dishes are available à la carte and we opt for the sautéed kale.  It's nothing to write home about but gives us our daily dose of vegetables.As with most things, what goes up must come down and in aviation-speak our dinner had a hard landing.  A dark chocolate torte that was reminiscent of a two-bite brownie drizzled in cheap store-bought chocolate sauce with some berries thrown on top.  The Panna-Colada was equally pedestrian as it loosely resembled those cheap complimentary desserts you'd get at the end of a Chinese dinner - all gelatin and not much else.The message at the end of the day is - don't let the appearances at Table 17 fool you.  While everything looks great from the outside, the experience lacks substance.Our meal with 2 glasses of wine and 3 coffees came just shy of $300.  Suffice it to say, this will be the last time I dine at Table 17."	mr4FiPaXTWlJ3qGzp4-7Yg	3	2014-09-10	1	1

The hot balls we were excited to try. 1/3 made the grade. Each hot ball is something different, fried risotto, goat cheese or crab croquette with its unique dipping sauce. Loved the goat cheese and honey, the other two were okay.POLENTA - served hot on a board with a duck confit topping, pepper and parmesan cheese. The far and away highlight of the meal. Came served on a board with a few sprigs of fresh basil and the chef served the topping at the table. Could have eaten this for dinner alone and left very impressed.Mains were lamb striploin with a ratatouille and a steak with the bone left on. Both were disappointing. The steak was very tough and overdone. The lamb was tender but lacked flavor and the sides seemed to be leftover add-ons. The recommended Malbec was spot on. The decor was interesting, low lighting and some strangely heavy music detracted from the atmosphere.Overall, I'd have to be convinced to go back. Maybe if someone promised me I could get two polenta and some wine.	mr4FiPaXTWlJ3qGzp4-7Yg	3	2009-08-09	1	1

Everything was perfect. Service was great. Prices were not cheap, but worth every bit. This is a place is good for 2 to 4 people who don't mind sharing some delicious plates and paying for quality.	mr4FiPaXTWlJ3qGzp4-7Yg	4	2014-07-18	0	0

However, the chimichurri sauce that replaced it was very good.	mr4FiPaXTWlJ3qGzp4-7Yg	4	2013-02-28	0	0

Went on a weeknight with my bf. waiter asked to take our coats, I paused to think if I wanted it taken and decided yes. Waiter remarks ""might as well get your money's worth, right?"". I was a little offended at the comment, I'm not going to lie to you. I am 28 year old professional but am constantly mistaken for a teenager- I think he judged us based on my ""age"" and our voucher. After that initial snafu his service was fairly good while he was around. He seemed genuinely interested in our opinions on the menu and food. Had the beef tar tar, which could have been better. The taste of Dijon mustard was very strong and the meat was cut up almost to mush (rather than small chunks). Waiter changed shifts while we were eating but we were never told and were made to wait a long time. The restaurant crowd wasn't my style either. Seemed like accomplished mid life adults who care a lot about $ and image. I prefer a more down to earth crowd (despite $ or age) and atmosphere- this could have just been the night we went (Tuesday). Food was good  but seemed slightly off mark. I expected better based on the reputation and price. I honestly felt like we were given the ""pretty woman"" young+poor treatment. Guess you can't tell by looking at us that we have good dual incomes and no children to eat up our $. Bc we had the voucher I didn't mind as much that we weren't taken seriously and that the food was lacking- we were underpaying for it anyway!All in all the food is a lot better than most restaurants. I think my dish was possibly good but not put together with has much care on a that particular night. My mashed potatoes were absolutely fantastic. Deserts were good too, nice and light. I wouldn't chance going back and getting similar service while paying full price. It wouldn't be worth it."	mr4FiPaXTWlJ3qGzp4-7Yg	3	2014-06-14	1	0

But when my BFF requested we go to Table 17 for her birthday, I put on my big girl pants and made my way to the East. Walking along queen, east of Broadview, I was amazed at how much has changed (I lived on Broadview and Dundas years ago and this was NOT the place to be). Once we arrived at Table 17 I was really impressed with the overall vibe. Warm, inviting, with minimal segregation from the kitchen to the dining area (I love seeing who's making my meal!). I had oysters to start and the beef tartare for my main. It was chalked full of flavour. Everyone else at the table really enjoyed their dishes as well (Some fish, some pasta... no weak meal was served). The server was wonderful. He had a great balance of being helpful and present at times and then absent when he wasn't needed. Great venue... worth making the trek across the yonge street tracks.	mr4FiPaXTWlJ3qGzp4-7Yg	4	2013-05-06	0	0

Today I have the Alsatian tart with salad and I enjoyed every bite of it.  I'm really shocked to read all the reviews about bad service.  Having been to this restaurant six or so times now, I have never once encountered any rudeness.  Maybe I've just lucked out.	mr4FiPaXTWlJ3qGzp4-7Yg	4	2012-02-04	0	0
0	3MbAc0Q7WEIGBIihksNTJA	3ljuhghMnJDB_ZuGiVtRvQ	I am reluctant to write a review for Table 17 only because I want it to be Leslieville's best kept secret! I went for brunch with my husband and a friend. For Saturday brunch at prime brunching hour, we were quickly seated. The place wasn't full like all the surrounding places so not only were we served quickly, but we were also not rushed out the door. It made a great easy Saturday morning. Serving staff were friendly and helpful. We loved that their bread comes from Bonjour Brioche, the best bakery east of the Don! My tart was so flaky and warm. Great sweet and savoury flavours in an appropriate portion for brunch. Everyone's plates were well-presented. The decor had rustic charm and we didn't feel crammed in like many small brunch spots. Our coffees and water were constantly refilled and I spent an easy afternoon sitting and catching up with friends. What more can you ask for to make an enjoyable and easy-going Saturday brunch? I would definitely return to Table 17.	mr4FiPaXTWlJ3qGzp4-7Yg	5	2014-08-24	0	0
0	tYk7mMGGFl3gLfmhST5L-A	_lRk2d0vsLvJNrpzn_e85w	The only downside about this place is that somehow I've only just discovered it!My friend and I walked in around 11:00am on a Saturday after a workout. The restaurant was reasonably busy but there was no line-up - a welcome change for weekend brunch in Leslieville/Riverdale! The interior is dark wood/brick and quite cozy. Realistically, we were a little under-dressed for the occasion but they welcomed us in any event.My friend had a dish (whose name escapes me) but consisted of eggs served on bolognese sauce on top of polenta. I had the quiche with a tomato salad. Both were really fantastic. Brunch entrees were reasonably priced at about $10.During our meal we saw a server walk by wih an order of frites and quickly decided we had to order them. No regrets here - crispy, salty, and delicious! At $4, totally worth it.I would absolutely return and recommend.	mr4FiPaXTWlJ3qGzp4-7Yg	5	2011-05-25	1	2

There was a '96 Bourdeaux that just had to be drunk and so my friend and I spent a lovely Sunday evening dinner obliging.  Table D'hote gives you a  selection of pork belly, steak frites, trout and a vegetarian option with a selection of first courses and desserts to go with it.  Neither of our dishes disappointed.  What we got was high quality, well prepared bistro fare at a very reasonable price.  Service was efficient if not overly friendly. I remain a fan of this cosy Queen East bistro and wouldn't think twice about many repeat visits.	mr4FiPaXTWlJ3qGzp4-7Yg	4	2012-03-19	2	2

0	zbSBmoujGgIPuNWQcny14g	pPPk-A3Hx6YApitBccDWsA	Lovely ambience, we had a nice table for 2 by the window. I'm sure the table beside us could hear our conversation as we could hear theirs when there was a pause in ours. The service started off being attentive and slowly started to slip (e.g. My date had to go find a waiter to get me a side plate for me to put shells from my seafood linguine, despite me having asked for it 5 min earlier). The fresh oysters were amazingly delicious and fresh! I enjoy dipping my bread in olive oil and Table 17's olive oil was no better or worse then any other nice restaurant's. My seafood linguine was average. I believe my date had lamb and he said it was fine. We also ordered a bottle of wine and felt their wine selection was appropriate. Overall, we weren't blow out of the water and have made no plans to go back as we were expecting more. Make sure you make a reservation!	mr4FiPaXTWlJ3qGzp4-7Yg	3	2014-03-28	0	0
2	AlXx0P-OhUylep0jNi773g	J5x0w4x7D1mkUAtUbK9dMw	The summary of 3 stars for Table 17 is that it's too expensive for it's location and quality.  It's still pretty good, I just don't like seeing a cheque for $60 for brunch.  The good:- The food is good and the ingredients are top quality- Sundays and Mondays it's bring your own wine with no corkage fees- Brunch has a 14oz Blanche de Chamblis with a splash of OJ for $4 which is the best value on this menu- They do potato rosti right- Sarah T orders TWO sides of bangers because she loves them so much... I really do like their bacon- Good service both times I've been- Proximity to my house- they use opentableThe bad:- It is too expensive.  The breakfasts don't come with sides, and sides each cost $4. So scrambled eggs with toast is $10, plus bacon is $14 plus hashbrowns is $18. I could maybe stomach $14.95 for a complete brunch, but I hate paying 10$ for eggs then having to add on the things I feel should come with it.  Maybe I'm not classy enough to eat bacon here.- It's not as good as Le Select brunch, which I don't mind splurging $60 on once in awhile. I won't spend my $60 here instead of there. (both times I've been here Sarah T picked.)No funny stories.Would I go here again?  Maybe.  I might try it out for dinner one one of the BYOB nights.  Man, this place is just too expensive.  I know that's all I keep saying about it, but they charge too much for the food here.	mr4FiPaXTWlJ3qGzp4-7Yg	3	2010-01-05	8	1

My Friend and I were planning on going to The Comrade which is 4 units West of Table 17 but their food selection was limited.  The Comrade bartender recommend this place so we thought we'd give it a whirl.  There was a good feel to this two roomed restaurant, classy but not fancy.  There was a long wooden table in the middle of the 2nd room where the wait staff cut bread and got their serving supplies from which I thought was a nice touch.  The waitress we had was extremely helpful in her recommendations, both in food and drink and cute as could be.I will return.	mr4FiPaXTWlJ3qGzp4-7Yg	4	2010-07-16	0	0
2	EhO5C7t3yfGFLvsTyK5PPw	DexBF1k8zV3lW9sNzpB0jg	I can't seem to make the half star symbol work because I'd give Table 17 three and a half stars. I found myself there late last night where I met up with an old friend for dinner. I have been wanting to go there for a while so when I found myself on the eastern side of the city dealing with a late day work issue I seized the opportunity. I can't say all that much about the decor as we sat on the side western side of the restaurant right by the door (in all fairness, we just walked in and had no res so we knew it would be hit or miss). The other side of the restaurant, from what I could see, looked lovely and it appears that they have one of those large chef's tables as well. Specials of the day included an unusual app of deep fried Zucchini flowers stuffed with ricotta (3 on a plate). The waiter explained that these flowers were only available for about two weeks of the year and it was a very special menu addition. The main menu is not that large with approx. half the mains being some sort of fish (arctic chair, salmon, halibut, scallops). We started with the charcuterie board because I wanted to compare it with the charcuterie board that my fellow yelper, Deanna and I shared at Swirl the day before. The bread they served was very unusual, some sort of blueberry bread with walnuts in it. Very fresh but very heavy. The board consisted of four different types of meats, a small terrine of chicken pate, a couple of dried figs with walnuts shoved in them, no cheese of any sort, nor any savory (I have this thing for olives!).  Pate was pretty good but not anywhere near as good as the pate we chowed down on at Swirl. Would have loved the figs if maybe they had squeezed some mascarpone into them and then shoved the nuts in. I'm such a foodie critic. To drink we ordered the McManis Cabernet Sauvignon ($55) and it is a very reliable bottle of red. I opted for (let's be predictable Christine) the steak frites and my friend had the poached halibut. The steak was delicious and cooked to order (medium rare). The frites are so crispy, crunchy and tangled, just the way I love them but what the hell is up with all the salt? I mentioned this to the waiter when he asked me how my meal was and then to his credit he brought out an little bowl of frites sans salt. He insisted. He also apologized for the kitchen as he said sometimes they don't realize how much kosher salt they are tossing into the bowl when they shake up the frites. The halibut was meaty but bland as hell. Then again, it is poached. Great if you are on a diet. Personally I felt it could have been poached in perhaps a court bouillon with lots of fresh herbs. My friend began picking at my plate which tells me that she wasn't sated by her dinner because she dived right into the bowl of extra frites. We passed on dessert. After all that meat there was no way I could eat dessert (urp!). All in all, I liked Table 17. The service was great, our waiter as friendly and stayed on top of making sure our glasses were looked after. Still, something just felt slightly off for me and I can't quite put my finger on it. Perhaps it may have just been our location inside of the restaurant, I never really felt like I was in it.  I would be willing though, in all fairness, to give Table 17 another go.   The lamb sounded wonderful as did a couple of the specials of the day.  I so gotta learn to step outside my steak obsession!	mr4FiPaXTWlJ3qGzp4-7Yg	3	2009-08-07	2	2

We then returned for Sunday dinner and realized they have no corkage fees that evening, what a nice surprise.The people running this restaurant get it, down to every detail. The servers are very friendly and helpful. The decor is nice, nothing overdone, just comfortable and 'rustic chic' which fits the type of place they are and food they serve. Speaking of food, it's the best part. I don't have a high end palate, but I can say that I enjoyed every dish and felt the pricing was fair. Servings were generous so you won't come away hungry.

0	Je9hP1439B3jp4y-nBgiMw	eOa6zF8E1CC3ZW5poylHgA	I had very high expectations of Table 17 as it was recommended to us by a bartender at Origin (where I had a phenomenal experience - see my review) and a good family friend (who has exquisite taste). What do they say about having high expectations? You will usually be disappointed. Sigh. And so it goes... I loved the space at Table 17. It felt classy rustic, if that makes sense. The intimate bistro (composed of two small rooms) had wood floors and walls, antique lights and a subdued color palette. I felt relaxed. The service was superb. Our waitress was more than a joy and spouted all the day's specials by memory and was well-versed in the few wines we were deciding between. She was attentive, humorous and gave great recommendations. The food? It was good, but forgetable (don't hate me, Table 17!). I wanted them to elevate the flavors. Punch me in the face and make me giddy. Make me moan with pleasure (food here people, get your mind out of the gutter!). Make me want to lick the plate clean. Like the last green leaf on a tree whose leaves are changing with the Autumn air, the dolce forte wild boar polenta was the sparkling highlight in the crowd. They change the polenta frequently, but it's a must order. Even if you don't like polenta, order it. The presentation itself is worth it. You are brought a thick slice of wood where the polenta is perched. Two table spoons of fresh herbs and red pepper flakes accompany it. Chef John Sinopoli comes out himself and scoops the pipping hot wild boar out of the pot and onto the polenta as he explains the ingredients and care that went into it. It was delicious. Not too gamy, not too heavy, just right. I would have liked it a bit saltier, but maybe that's just me. I have an addiction to salt (blush). We also ordered the chilled white gazpacho (definitely recommend), charcuterie board (typical), warm roasted beets side dish (yummy but I wanted more goat cheese!), summer arugula salad with blue cheese and peaches (the peaches were lovely) and the steak tartare. I am a sucker for steak tartare and always order it when it's on the menu. Table 17 serves it differently, they mix beets into the chopped beef. While some may like this, I did not. It tasted like beets, not meat. I missed the salt (shocked?), the capers, the onions, the quail egg on top, the savory flavors of a traditional steak tartare. I know every restaurant can't be phenomenal, but at those prices, I am a bit tougher on the food and my expectations are a bit higher. I liked Table 17. I would give it another shot.	mr4FiPaXTWlJ3qGzp4-7Yg	3	2010-09-08	3	3
0	7_RaCe5zzPBYWm9znlffUA	IJu2nUgiiEyvKjd4mA59gw	Appetizer:Hot Balls: Arancino - Mushroom & Fontina stuffed risotto, Goat cheese - with wildflower honey, Arancino - Spiced lamb stuffed risotto with mintMy friend asked me which one is which as she could not decipher. The flavours of each is not very strong....like it didn't punch you in the face. The mushroom flavour was not very full. The lamb flavour was very slight. The one with the most flavour is the goat cheese ball. It really had to be elevated by the sauce at the side. I actually had no issue with that because I often find the gamey taste of lamb and goat distasteful. She on the other hand was slightly disappointed about the legendary hot balls from Table 17. Diver Scallops: Diver Scallops with Roasted with fresh bay leaves, served with sauce béarnaise & guancialeI liked this dish. It was again on the heavier and saltier side. Everything plated works together harmoniously. The scallop balanced the béarnaise and the guanciale perfectly. The texture of the scallop is escalated by the crunchiness of the guanciale. Entrée:Haddock: Haddock with chanterelle mushroom, sprouts, truffled potato, radishPerhaps our expectations for fresh seafood is a little high. We both felt the haddock is lacking in freshness. Fresh fish tends to hold together better. The sprouts were supposed to reduce the heaviness of the dish but it just wasn't enough. Dessert:Lemon Panna Cotta with Blueberry compote. This dessert hit all the right notes! The panna cotta was silky and smooth (like my legs...just kidding!) The delicious blueberry compote adds fruitiness (DUH!) to the plate! The lemon balm gives it a bite of citrus taste. It was awesome! The combination just sings in your mouth! I can eat that all day! Nom nom nom! In the end, I wish the chef would balance the dishes with more acids, spices and fresh herbs instead of sodium and grease. We are definitely anomalies here. Table 17 had garnered a lot of loyal patrons over the years. I really wanted to fall in love with this cosy little restaurant!	mr4FiPaXTWlJ3qGzp4-7Yg	4	2012-02-06	0	1
0	3TdL8QTy4XOWo6BVQJIqQg	fbUfvWQw9ScdGinxahPutg	I am a fairly regular dinner guest at Table 17, and thought it was time to leave a review.Among the cosy bistros popping up in Leslieville, Table 17 was among the first, and is among the best for its consistency in quality of food and service. I also really appreciate the Sunday & Monday BYOB nights, and wish other restaurants would take Table 17's lead on this generous offering.I am always happy to see my favourite mains such as the braised beef short ribs and steak frites on the menu (and I happily order them over and over each visit - the fries appear to be crisply double fried in duck fat in traditional Belgian style. Yumm!) That said, the menu does not seem to have changed very much over the years, and I almost wish they would take that risk and do a bit of a menu refresh. I still give it 4 stars because I go there when I crave my favourites. When I'm feeling adventurous, I just go a little further west on Queen to Ruby Watchco.	mr4FiPaXTWlJ3qGzp4-7Yg	4	2012-03-23	0	0

Tonight we got the right amount of attention without feeling rushed. The menu is well edited with interesting selections. We choose the artichokes and  bocconcini as the starters followed by venison and steak tartare, with sides of amazing Brussels sprouts and frites. All excellent, but the venison was truly a standout. I have been here a couple of times, but tonight was the best. Certainly will return.	mr4FiPaXTWlJ3qGzp4-7Yg	4	2015-01-22	0	0
0	NL8ULDSd476vP3PtU4pvfw	wcgtJ2FMQjcOJsa_glqP2Q	I think the main problem with this place is that it is too small to accommodate people who may want to hang out after dinner and have a few drinks. There is a bar, but it's small. As for the food: quality ingredients, food cooked simply, and the right way. The trout was prepared perfectly. Overdone fish can be a problem, but not here. The food was also not over-seasoned, which is one of my peeves with restaurant food in general. The flavors of the foods themselves are predominant here. Not that I don't enjoy spice, but there is a balance.The duck rillette was really delightful, and I am generally not a huge duck fan. I'm not sure if that was orange zest or I imagined it in there, that's how subtle the flavors can be, but  I loved it. Especially the piquance of the pickled carrots with the toast and meat. Would have bought a quart of the pickles if we had room in our luggage. The duck-fatted mash was bit too heavy for me that night, but my fiance had no trouble finishing it off. They give you a good heaping pile.  The greens were perfect to me--again, very simply prepared. The arugala salad had the perfect amount of dressing on it. A little too much goat cheese on it for me though, could have been balanced more in that way for me. We might even go back before we leave Toronto  to try the Polenta, which unfortuntely they were out of.	mr4FiPaXTWlJ3qGzp4-7Yg	4	2010-10-25	1	2

The restaurant is divided into two rooms - the first room you walk into features a long bar and some seating and the room towards the side which we get seated in, is simple, farmhouse chic.  The menu has amazing sharing plates and we do choose a couple to start with. We were very impressed with the presentation of the polenta du jour dish.  This is a must at Table 17!  The fluffy, white polenta, dished out on a wooden cutting board was accompanied by the chef who ladled a ""ragu"" of steaming lamb on top of it. There was chili and dried basil on little spoons for more flavour.  It was heart-warming, a generous portion - ideal for our group of 3.  The lamb ragu was flavourful and the polenta with some grated Parmesan cheese and cracked pepper was still light as air.As a note, Sundays and Mondays it's bring your own wine with no corkage fees with decent prix fix menu on offer"	mr4FiPaXTWlJ3qGzp4-7Yg	4	2011-06-23	0	0

The restaurant was clearly understaffed and our server rushed us all night.To be fair, the hot balls and kale salad were very good appetizers. The main course was a huge disappointment. My fiancé ordered the trout on a recommendation from our server. It was bland and undercooked. The avocado mousse tasted processed and fake. I ordered the Simcoe County Pork Chop after our server highly recommended it over the steak frites. Super bland, no spices. Maybe it was an off night as there seem to be mostly positive reviews, but we left disappointed.	mr4FiPaXTWlJ3qGzp4-7Yg	2	2013-10-05	0	0

I found it to be fabulous, and I'm in the industry myself, so I know what the job entails. Our server explained the specials and gave us some great recommendations for drinks and menu items.The hot balls (arroncini) were fabulous and small enough to add on to any meal without spoiling your appetite. Lamb leg and merguez sausage wad fabulous and surprisingly lean.Desserts looked fab, although we were too full, but I loved that the cheese platter was priced with a glass of tawny port. Delicious.Overall, a great dining experience and will be back for sure!!!P.S. when you use a groupon, please please please remember to tip on the amount before discount. Your server worked just as hard as he or she would for any other patron and it's in very bad taste to not acknowledge this.	mr4FiPaXTWlJ3qGzp4-7Yg	5	2013-03-23	0	0

0	imPfhpAk61DqSW6K47D4QQ	EKIrMW8Do8rR3OtdQY6f1Q	I'm confused as to how to rate Table 17. When I lived in Toronto I ate here quite a bit for brunch and so when visiting the area again I was excited to go back. The food and service were good, but my confusion lies in the cost of the Caesar at brunch time. It used to be $4.50 or $5. I saw they have a super special one on menu for $12 but I cannot justify paying that much for a Caesar. So I ordered a regular one, followed by another regular one. I was shocked when the bill came and they were $9/each. Ouch!My bad for not reading the menu fully and noticing they are not part of the discounted brunch drinks anymore.	mr4FiPaXTWlJ3qGzp4-7Yg	3	2014-08-23	0	0

We got the French toast which was two slices with fruits. We also got a side of rosti. Everything was really delicious and unique. I've been searching for a great French toast and this one was right up at the top. Full of flavour but not too heavy. Prices were all pretty reasonable around $10-$12. We'll be coming back for sure!	mr4FiPaXTWlJ3qGzp4-7Yg	5	2014-03-22	0	0

0	p8rCTA139YIM6DQNq5s5XA	2v685kARRKjNxjxAaHYbfA	For a small place, Table 17 is very accommodating.  I was a part of a very large party (10+ people) who could not make up their mind.  Various members called the restaurant multiple times to change our reservation.  I was horrified that when we showed up, they were going to turn us away (I would!).  But, they did not.  Everyone was very friendly and welcoming.  Our table was waiting for us when we arrived, and we were all served very quickly.  The waiter made excellent suggestions for drinks, apps, and entrees.  Everyone was happy with their meal.  The ambience is nice, quiet yet trendy.  The bathrooms were immaculate and while we were in the front room near the bar, the back room had a center table as a servers station for bread and wine bottles.  The only downside is that the entrees were very small - fortunately they weren't horribly expensive.   The drinks on the other hand.... Let's just say I'm very happy I wasn't paying ($15 for a basic martini).	mr4FiPaXTWlJ3qGzp4-7Yg	3	2010-10-25	2	2

They have some fun cocktails, and the ambiance is great.  The nature of the menu (not traditional brunch obviously) precipitates only infrequent visits (I'm and eggs benny guy on Sunday mornings) but when we go we love it.	mr4FiPaXTWlJ3qGzp4-7Yg	4	2014-07-27	0	0
1	Uwu72w77MPox942_GnCS7g	k5R2b5ZdTsxH5dFl5JdUpA	All hail the mighty Groupon, without which I never would have experienced this place. After a really long, rainy, and cold school week during which my meals mainly consisted of stuff I grabbed from convenience stores on campus, I really needed a good dinner. Table 17 hit just the right spot. We started with a charcuterie plate, which was all kinds of good and porky. The standout starter for me, though, was the Ribollita soup -- a white bean soup with pancetta and kale. I could live off bowls of that stuff. For my main, I chose the braised short ribs. They were fork tender, but slightly dry and tough on top -- maybe I got the top of the pot or something -- but still delicious and just the perfect comfort food that I needed.Service was great for the most part, but they were experiencing problems with their credit card machine that was a little frustrating -- they didn't seem to have a separate phone line for their credit card machine, so every time someone would call the restaurant, it would kick the credit card machine offline. Consequently, it took FOREVER to get our card charged for dinner. The food was excellent and I'm definitely coming back soon (dying to try their BYOW Table D'hote on Sundays and Mondays), but next time I visit, I'm totally bringing cash.	mr4FiPaXTWlJ3qGzp4-7Yg	4	2010-11-24	1	2

0	uHZr3XbjKvRTwdXLXrFuvg	L3DqaARjr6I7RziyxMFERA	I've been to Table 17 twice, and since the first time I came here, I have been anticipating the next time I would reunite with the sticky toffee bread pudding!With a groupon in my hand and the final days ticking before expiration, I knew I had to get in here for what I hoped to be a fantastic dinner.The tables were a little bit close, but not intruding and the waiter was patient and informative with the questions I had (I always have questions!)For our shared appie, we went with the Burrata because I have been looking for a good burrata dish since I moved back to TO and had not found it yet.- I tried one at Reds last year and thought that it was not creamy enough and unfortunately, this one missed the mark as well. I thought that there was not mixture between the mozza and cream, so the soft texture of the burrata was lacking. The flavours and other components of the dish paired very well.. just wish there was more creamy goodness.It happened to be Good Friday and I really did not plan to eat meat that night. I was tempted to go with the shortribs because I knew I would not be disappointed from my first experience. I was debating between the pasta and one of the fish dishes but there was one component of each dish that did not speak to me.On a whim, I went with the scallops at the very last second. It came in a creamy broth (was not a fan at first read) but it had been quite some time since I had some good scallops and I definitely had set some high expectations. On first bite..... I was grinning ear to ear... the scallops were perfectly cooked, loads of flavour in the broth, and I could not get enough. I'm just not a super big fan of clams, so I cannot really comment on them. None the less, I tried to scoop up ever last ounce of the broth on the plate! The short ribs were tender (husband's review), and very tasty.For dessert .... I did not have to look at the menu - sticky toffee pudding it is.... it came out hot in a ramekin, loaded with caramel sauce and apple butter on the side. Rich, decadent, tasty, mouth watering..... it was just like I remembered and more! S had the banana cheesecake, which I was hesitant about because I'm not sure how that could go well together... but it was actually surprisingly subtle but evident in banana flavour. With a touch of peanut butter to finish it off, the dessert was a great choice.I'm so glad that my second experience was just as good as the first. As someone who doesn't repeat restaurants often, I can vouch that this one will not disappoint.	mr4FiPaXTWlJ3qGzp4-7Yg	4	2013-04-28	0	0
2	TbhyP24zYZqZ2VJZgu1wrg	VjDmZq8wyyAjBarXceWstQ	"I can never resist hot ballZ (sexy menu item here at Table 17).Conveniently located near Jilly's (hey!!!), Table 17 is possibly a little too beautiful for the neighbourhood, but I suppose that makes it a true diamond in rough because it's such a nice place.I tried the Ontario lamb with merguez sausage (lamb x 2!) for my entree. Lamb was cooked perfectly (medium rare) and the merguez was delicious. A perfect plate.The hot balls come 3 ways and each is served with it's own dipping sauce. I think these are a ""must have"" if you come here.The service was excellent and our water & wine was always kept topped off .It's a small place with only a few tables, dark hardwood, large mirrors, chandeliers and a nice long wooden table in the middle with food artfully displayed. Definitely a great date spot.The wine list is extensive but the price point was a bit over the top - no bottles under $60 and the 1/2 liters started at $45.

0	mb_8jXannipO5T5V5kGXiQ	VKcXJGdqyB0EO5LLfGeHfw	Table 17 is okay. The hot balls are pretty standout although for $12 for 6 ($2 a ball) I'm not sure I would order them again (thank you miracle of groupon-type discount!). The goat cheese balls were excellent, reminding me I never get enough goat cheese in my diet or to my liking. I would not recommend dipping them in the accompanying honey. The sweet just masks the wild goat cheese taste. Actually, it would be nice if you could order 6 goat cheese hot balls straight up.My pickerel was a big bowl of meh. It tasted like something you might get during a summer/winterlicious. Being from the Lake Erie region, I like a tenderly cooked pickerel that allows you to enjoy the delicate texture and nuanced flavor of this white fish. But Table 17 prepares it extra crispy, burning the joy out of this fish. Slinky woman ordered the arctic char and seemed to have no complaints.Portions are a touch small given the prices. You get a couple slices of decent bread before your meal.Service is excellent.Table 17 seems a nice addition to the aspirational bars that have cropped up in Leslieville along Queen street. The only thing I hate about Leslieville is it seems so dark. The strip needs some BIA work.	mr4FiPaXTWlJ3qGzp4-7Yg	3	2011-11-14	1	1
0	FTNaQZ3t0dsVWw1WZUQGFg	IN36oY4LbL3Ts_yXXBRTmw	Quite a great meal. Came early and even though we booked using OpenTable and it was busy, we were allowed to sit. Special was Foie gras and said yes before the words were out of the servers mouth. Shared tartare and it was glorious with a very large hint of moutarde, but U dug it. Shoulder of Ontario lamb was great with a hint of mint in the salsa verde. I'm not a dessert guy but the Gateau Elvis with chocolate, caramelized bananas and peanut butter was awshum. Nice wine list. Will return soon. Only thing hindering a 5-star is the fact that we had to top up our own wine a couple times.	mr4FiPaXTWlJ3qGzp4-7Yg	4	2010-01-17	3	1

Steak tartare could have been a bit colder as the dish is meant to be served cold.  Shared PEI Oysters were very fresh & succulent. For the prices paid, I expected a little more out of Table 17. There are better options out there for the price range.	mr4FiPaXTWlJ3qGzp4-7Yg	3	2011-10-24	0	0

I even enjoyed my Lamb Polenta and I am not a lamb or polenta lover!The restaurant did get busy even on a weekday evening.

My party of 2 got there around 9 pm and waited about 10 minutes to be seated. Unfortunately that's how the night continued. The decor is nice but very loud, with a large table in the middle of the main dining room for the servers to cut bread which we didn't receive until about 20 minutes after we were seated. We ordered drinks and decided none of the entrees looked appealing enough to pay about $28 bucks plus for, so we shared appetizers. We waited about 15 minutes for our drink. When we finally received our food at about 9:45 it was nothing special. To top it all off even i got the bill and they charged me for an entree I didn't even order. There are too many options in the area to go back for a mediore experince.	mr4FiPaXTWlJ3qGzp4-7Yg	2	2013-10-06	0	0

0	Jt1zgNmwz_jheOSmEsljPQ	bLHMKw5LEXUCodI5-F8yww	I had the most wonderful experience at Table 17 recently. I took advantage of the Telus Taste of Tuesday promotion in which you get a free appetizer and dessert with the purchase of an entrée. To top it off, parking was free at this part of town after 6 pm on weekdays. My boyfriend had the potato and bacon soup. I had two delicious spoonfuls of the soup. I enjoyed chewing on the bits of bacon, which added a delectable smokiness to the creamy soup. I ordered the appetizer special of the day - chicken liver parfait. I absolutely loved this! The liver spread was delightfully creamy and I loved that intense flavour of the liver, complemented by a dab of tangy Dijon mustard.Steak Frites - 8oz thick cut top sirloin, served with lemon mayo - was executed to perfection. The steak was juicy, flavourful and amazingly tender. I really enjoyed the meat, but what stood out the most for me was the lemon mayo, which was, in one word, addictive. I wanted to eat it all right off a spoon. I had the striped bass, served over sweet onion purée and tartar garnish, with beer battered sweet dumpling squash and hen of the woods mushroom. I enjoyed all the components on the plate, and everything worked well together. The fish was perfectly cooked and the skin was nice and crispy. I wiped my whole plate clean and wanted more. For dessert, our first choice was the maple panna cotta, topped with candied bacon strips. The bacon's saltiness really brought out the sweetness of the panna cotta and also provided a great crunch. The panna cotta, which came out resembling a block of tofu, was creamy and satisfying.Our other dessert choice was the honey and pistachio tart with crème anglaise. I loved that there was a generous amount of nuts in every bite. I wished the pistachio could be a little more toasted and crunchier, but the tart was, nevertheless, delicious. It was a delicious meal and a great experience altogether. I can't wait to go back.	mr4FiPaXTWlJ3qGzp4-7Yg	5	2011-05-04	1	1

We walked in expecting to be turned away, especially since it was quarter past 10pm,  and were graciously seated at a pretty table by the window. The atmosphere was perfect - mellow but happy crowd lingering over dessert, attentive hostesses dressed casual and candlelight in a rustic contemporary decor.The menu isn't extensive but offers a good variety to please any dietary preferences. We ordered the soft shell crab to start and it was set on top of a green chutney which elevated the taste of the crab and was just delicious. I had the lemon caper pasta which was really good and my DH ordered the lamb which was falling-off-the-bone goodness on a plate. We finished with the toffee cake dessert and it is high on my list of favorite desserts. It was decadent, luscious and big enough to share (but who wants to!).A great evening and I am glad we didn't get a table anywhere else - Table 17 rocks!"	mr4FiPaXTWlJ3qGzp4-7Yg	5	2011-06-09	2	2
0	s19c8t_yAmFrby90LjDk8g	HAz9jl1PJnnnN_n_Y2XQeQ	My partner and I went to Table 17 for dinner while on a visit to Toronto, we both felt that this was a very good restaurant based on both food and service.Our hotel was in the financial center, so we wanted to explore a different part of Toronto, and the server at another restaurant said good things about Table 17. The atmosphere there is rather romantic, with candlelight and a somewhat dark setting. It's not a very large restaurant, but the small space doesn't make it too loud.The menu we had was prix fixe with an appetizer, entrée, and dessert. Since there were two of us, we were able to try a good portion of the menu, and we were rather impressed with what we got. My pork belly entree was very tasty and light.  My partner had the steak frites for entrée, and I while normally tend to stay away from steaks at a non-steakhouse (because you never know what you're going to get), this steak was tender, charred, and very well-executed.The service was definitely a bright spot here. Our waitresses very friendly and indulged all are crazy questions and requests.Overall, I would definitely recommend Table 17 for either a group dinner or romantic dinner. There's one table right by the window that was open when we arrived, and we asked to sit there but the hostess said that people reserve some tables by number because they're good. If you care, that one is ...Table 23. ;)	mr4FiPaXTWlJ3qGzp4-7Yg	5	2013-01-08	0	0
1	8lL-554wLEOxCrroFa4aeg	dEmvzghnkGHFLo_jR9rfHQ	I've been a resident here for almost 3 years, and I've been pleased with my time here.  First off, location is great for Scottsdale within walking distance to Sandbar, California Pizza Kitchen, At One Yoga, and a gas station, and plenty of other options within driving distance.  Approximately 10 minutes to both Kierland Commons, North, and Scottsdale Fashion Square, South.  My specific apartment is on the 2nd (top) floor, and the high ceiling and sky light make the living room fill with natural light.   We pay an average price for the area, 1100/month, and that's after 2 years of raising it.  I have always, always, always felt safe there, which is important for a single woman in her 20's.  There are 3 pools on site too.  As far as office/management, Karen is firm and can come across as harsh, but she is just doing her job.  Maintenance is AMAZING - after several days of my key sticking in the lock I called maintenance and in less than 30 minutes I had someone come up, look at the problem, get a new lock part, and fix it!  Good service, helpful attitude.  Only negatives would be parking on the weekend and that they don't accept UPS packages anymore, so you have to go to the Post Office to get them.  Annoying.  It's also noisy on the occassional Friday or Saturday night - but never bad enough that I couldn't sleep.	wjRFf_lTn5WyP-s6Ce2amg	4	2008-10-11	7	3

The water to my apartment has just been shut off 3 times in 3 months. The first time, the guy doing their renovations cut a line, the they had a scheduled outage that resulted in dirt in my lines, and now I wake up and there is no water and I can't get a hold of anyone at the leasing office or maintenance to ask if it will be on in time for me to shower before work!Also, there is a line that drips from behind my washing machine to an open pipe and no one has ever come by to fix it after complaining to the front office. They also can't keep the walkway light by my apartment stairs lit, and I come home from work after it is dark. Since I come home after dark, I notice that it seems like the gates get stuck open pretty frequently.The new management company also doesn't believe in posting how much you owe before it is past due. You can either set up an auto withdrawal or risk they won't have it up before you are late.	wjRFf_lTn5WyP-s6Ce2amg	1	2013-10-31	1	0

I had liked what I'd seen on the walk-throughs, and everyone in the office was pleasant enough.  One thing I'd noticed, however, is that the prices for their available units change every day.  So I waited until the price was where I wanted it to be, and headed over with the full intent to sign a one-year lease.Right before I entered the leasing office, I pulled up their website on my phone and confirmed the amount.  I walked in and was seated with an agent/manager with whom I had toured the property less than a week ago.  We made small talk, and she pulled up the unit in question...and quoted me a price ten dollars higher than what I saw online.  It wasn't that big of a deal, but I was quite confused.I pulled up the price on my phone again and noted that at that very instant, there was a discrepancy between what she said and what I saw online.  Her defense was that ""[their] prices change every day,"" but when I asked about the accuracy of the online pricing, she just repeated the line.I tried to find out why she would give me a different price quote, and she just repeated the line again.  I had my phone, and the unit price, staring me in the face, and she was telling me that it was wrong!  She then said that I should have booked during the previous week and said goodbye, as she apparently wasn't willing to negotiate down to their listed price or explain what was going on.I have no idea why she couldn't say something like, ""Our website isn't accurate - you should call,"" or, ""Let me see what I can do"" or anything like that. She was willing to lose someone who was ready to sign ON THE SPOT because she couldn't be bothered to explain a slight difference in rent rates.If this is how they treat prospective tenants who WANT to live there and pay their rent, I can't imagine how they treat their residents."	wjRFf_lTn5WyP-s6Ce2amg	1	2012-05-05	2	0
0	4TDeDywE3LL-jI8lQ1uRTw	_7I-gyu2TEVtkBSIv56srA	I don't expect much out of an apartment complex... lets be honest... we all had negative experiences that just make us hope for the essentials and that the staff will somewhat acknowledge your existence past routine notes taped to your door. That was my mentality before I moved into Acacia and I am SO GLAD that I live here!! It is amazing! Between four years of college and four years of post college, I have lived in approximately 8 apt complexes in 3 states and Acacia Creek is the BEST overall!!! First and foremost, the staff and maintenance are just absolutely outstanding. If you have a request, they will tend to it immediately. They remember your name and call just to touch base and make sure things are okay. They are very respectful of your privacy and the grounds always stay clean and maintained. The complex is fairly quiet... and I don't even see my neighbors very often but it seems like more professional couples, young adults and singles... though there are some families with young children as well. There are 3 pools, and 1 is heated, a decent sized gym and lots of uncovered parking. (and a recycling bin!!!) The location is great! It's just South of Scottsdale and Shea, on Gold Dust Avenue. Lots of things within walking distance grocery stores (Fresh and Easy, Safeway), bars and restaurants (Baja Bar, Eddies, Chop and Wok, Indulge Burger, Dennys, Oregenos), and two pharmacies. It's about 10 minutes to Old Town and Kierland Commons, approx 5-7 minutes to the 51 and 5-7 minutes to the 101. The apts are nice. We live in a 2 bdrm/ 2 bath corner unit on the 2nd floor (top floor) with a fireplace and a HUGE patio (approx 7x15!). It has a nice skylight and an entire wall of windows. One design flaw I noticed is that there's only one AC vent in the living room area, while there are 3 in the master bedroom which is half the size. It does take a long time for the living room to cool down on the hot days (esp being a top floor, corner unit with lots of exposure to the afternoon sun). But the walls are 2 toned with a nice beige accent wall in every room, including the bathrooms. The master has a large walk in closet and lots of storage. There is also a full sized washer and dryer. The appliances are older Hotpoints, but they work well so no real complaints outside of aesthetic purposes. Overall, if you are looking for an affordable option in the heart of Scottsdale, or you are new to the area and want somewhere safe and comfortable... DEFINITELY consider Acacia Creek.. you will not be disappointed!!	wjRFf_lTn5WyP-s6Ce2amg	5	2011-05-28	0	0

The Rare Bookstore and Andrew's Ties usually get a visit out of me.The fountain is usually the center of attention for tourists taking pictures of their sweeties or families.  If you sit near the water, don't move back too far or you'll get water down your pants!	RLFIsHWmOFm-WsGfOTmH5Q	3	2011-03-24	0	0

Stop by Christian Louboutin and admire the red bottoms. Right across the way they have a little wine shop/lounge area to take a load off and enjoy a flight of white or reds or both! I very much enjoyed cruising around the shops.	RLFIsHWmOFm-WsGfOTmH5Q	5	2015-12-04	7	7

The mall itself is kind of small, but it is really pretty inside. Some shops here include Fendi, Barney's New York, Cartier, Ralph Lauren (includes Black Label) and Michael Kors.. Among others! All the stores are really nice with marble floors and such! This is the best place to go besides Rodeo Drive and 5th Avenue in New York if you're looking for an upscale shopping experience!

Most stores barely had 1 customer in them. The stores didn't do anything for me. Bottom line: Nice but I much prefer walking around the shops of Caesar's and Venetian.

I haven't bought anything here, but I've spent several hours exploring the shops.  Bauman Rare Books is one of those fantastic stores where you want to walk around with your hands tied behind your back because you don't want to touch anything and leave a print on anything.  What an interesting shop.I also window shop and the tie shop and I smile when I think that I know longer have to wear a tie unless i want to.  Those are just two of the neat places in the Shoppes at the Palazzo.  I sometimes wonder how some stay in business because they're almost hiding in plain sight, but many people don't know the extent of the shoppes nor the different hallways that take you to different shops on different floors.

Lots of options for dining and a fun view of the ""Venice"" canals.  The reason why my rating is so low is based upon the number of irritating merchants trying to hawk their wares/goods.  Don't accept any samples from the brick/mortar stores either because as you can imagine they are pretty viscous.  The Tea store (?) store the salesman was so rude when I said I was not interested in trying their products.  I must have been approached by five or six different annoying salespeople as I'm trying to enjoy a leisurely stroll and shopping.  I must say my favorite place to shop is NorthPark Center in Dallas...no annoying kiosks or ""hawkers."""	RLFIsHWmOFm-WsGfOTmH5Q	3	2016-06-26	0	0

Chloé, Diane Von Furstenburg and Jimmy Choo all situated in one place! (They don't have a Chanel boutique but you will find one next door at the Wynn).  Basically, at The Palazzo, many of the stores have special collections you can't find anywhere else which is truly something ...If you go in December, you will find some awesome deals. The shoes at Barneys were half off, and many of the stores had seasonal pieces at 40% off. If you are looking for high end fashion items, this is the place to go.I'll def revisit when I come here, even for the sake of window shopping =)	RLFIsHWmOFm-WsGfOTmH5Q	5	2008-12-21	1	2

There is a nice selection of upscale shops.....Fendi, Billionaire, Burberry, Coach...and many more.  Those are a few of the shoppes The Better Half (TBH) and I like to browse.While we're here, we always make sure to stop by the Double Helix Wine Bar to enjoy a glass of Wine while we're shopping.Located on the 2nd floor of the Palazzo, it's away from the action of the Casino.  There's a good selection of restaurants on the 2nd floor as well.Will I return?  You can count on it.	RLFIsHWmOFm-WsGfOTmH5Q	4	2010-10-18	7	4
0	UY3x_8KhKlrqVSDE0QKV8A	p413PZ20FDb2n-F0KWSSIQ	A large collection of very upscale, world class stores. Although connected to the Venetian Canal, these two areas are worlds apart. The fountain area is very impressive, and very relaxing. I did notice that The Shoppes at Palazzo are very quiet and enjoyable, as there are virtually no children around. Very nice to grab a drink, walk through and enjoy the A/C, and do some fine window shopping.There are a few restaurants scattered throughout, but the majority of the area is populated with upper class stores. My girlfriend and I spent about an hour or so, walking and window shopping. She refused to go into any stores due to the price factor, however couldn't resist walking into the Jimmy Choo shoe store.Overall, an enjoyable experience. If you're like me and spent almost every bit of your savings to travel to Vegas, be prepared for a fun afternoon of looking at things you probably can't afford.

The mix what you need and what you want is dangerous because you can spend a lot of time and money over there and that's exactly what they are going for.  Nestled above the Palazzo Casino floor it feels much more welcoming than the Grand Canal Shoppes at the Venetian although you can't discount the difference in atmosphere being a good change of pace.  The Shoppes at the Palazzo is more of your ""traditional"" shopping setting.  This is a great place to go for shopping, dinning and just strolling around.

0	Kp5KHBSmV-Htc9NeSjJfPA	3n0PLe2xWz7GgCTH7q0gBA	Of note, the Shoppes have been rolled into The Grand Canal Shoppes at the Venetian/Palazzo  under General Growth Properties. I imagine most of us will continue to consider these shoppes a separate entity for history's sake. This swanky mall within The Palazzo and now connected to the Grand Canal Shoppes houses restaurants and a wine bar as well as a variety of retail shops. Most of them are of a pricey, upscale nature, yes. Some aren't, such as Victoria's Secret, Tommy Bahama and Sephora. Double Helix is a cute little kiosk type wine bar located in the center of the shopping area. I've been to some of the restaurants a number of times, such as Grimaldi's and sushisamba, which is a standout. The shoppes have 3 levels, which proved to be wishful thinking even 9 years after the place opened! The atmosphere is kind of relaxing when it's not busy, and window shopping is usually cheaper than gambling!	RLFIsHWmOFm-WsGfOTmH5Q	3	2017-04-19	1	0
0	7dnh9OrD8LekBwvachGH5Q	7kzi2KebVgEgROBQZXPkaw	Really nice shopping mall.  Beautiful with some really nice high end stores.  Some of its shortcomings are it's small compared to other malls or even casino shopping malls, it doesn't blow you away like the Venetian Grand Canal Shops or Caesar's Forum Shoppes.  Although it's attached to the Grand Canal shops. Nonetheless, because I never miss the Grand Canal Shops, I make the short walk to this place.  When you win the Megabucks, you can afford to shop here.	RLFIsHWmOFm-WsGfOTmH5Q	3	2014-02-15	0	0
1	EiwxlbR8fb68lMgEXhcWKA	DQLLzqFaFeOZetTok-KjVg	"I'm a little on the meh side for the Shoppes at the Palazzo because it's not a very inviting environment for shopping. It is true that some of the very high end, very up-scale stores reside here and without a lot of money its hard for you to enjoy this place. But wait!The Forum Shops have JUST as many or similar types of designer stores ... why is it more fun?Well in the end, I attribute it to the fact that the Forum Shops have some ""regular stores"" as to draw a crowd and shows which retain the crowd. You don't want to shop in an empty mall where you're the only person browsing the store (unless you REALLY don't care). I feel like a great shopping experience and the whole point of shopping in a store is for the interaction, direct or indirect, that you have with everyone else. When I walk into the Palazzo, it's so empty it makes me want to be somewhere else with more people despite the awesome designer stores.This is not to say I will boycott the Shoppes, but it's definitely not my popular choice."

8	y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ	sK9Ezn42uXIHxh20nXhmTA	Three words for you...High End Expensive. I can't give the Shoppes at the Palazzo any less than 5 stars because they market, advertise, and sell MONEY.  That's their main goal.  Put a bunch of high end stores together and make money.  Since they accomplish their goal, you can't fault them for it.  When it comes to expensive goodies, might as well set it up correctly and at one of the more classier casinos like the Palazzo.  All the stores are maintained, clean, and have some of the best service ever, like ever.  I've only been here a half dozen times and never bought anything due to my wine taste/beer budget.  But I can tell you one thing, you're never stereotyped here, you're never treated like you don't belong, and you're never more than a minute in a store without great service.  My issue...I just can't justify some of the expenses.  If I ever hit the CA Lottery (2, 23, 45, 55, 8, Mega 13) then you may finally find me here not window shopping, but actually getting something.

(I'm wondering myself why they added an 'e' in shoppes - maybe for that added flavor of pretention, haha). They definitely don't mess around here with high-end shops like Barney's New York, Coach, and Burberry just to name a few. Built just across the street from the Wynn Hotel and their own bougie shops, I'm sure they aim to cater to that same crowd. My friends and I walked into Michael Kors and there was a purse that caught her eye. She picks it up and then asked an associate how much it was. He casually replies, ""That one is $1400."" Upon hearing this, she immediately returned the purse to the display, looks at us, says ""Okay,"" and walks away from the bag. With our incomes, we can only dream about getting the stuff here. Unless you can afford all the things here and can actually purchase them - that seems like a lot more fun!Nothing special about the decor of the Shoppes. But, there is one thing worthy of note, a waterfall that is two-stories high at the center of the mall. Be prepared to see lots of tourists taking pictures. And hey, why not take one yourself? For the hard-working middle class schmo and ""normal"" crowds, I recommend the Miracle Mile shops or Fashion Show Mall. I'm sure once the blazing summer heat kicks in, people will use this mall as an air-conditioned excuse to stay off the strip."	RLFIsHWmOFm-WsGfOTmH5Q	2	2008-04-25	1	0

All the right elements that make a great diner style smashed burger ( freshly ground steak on site, no fillers, execellent layer of crust on the patty, can't forgot to mention house cut fries ) . I opted for the signature z- burger ( double cheese burger with lettuce, tomato, pickle, onion strings,z-sauce)with an order of Greek fries( Caramelized feta,evoo, and what I think was tzatiki sauce, awesome) , my partner went for the sorry eh burger( bacon cheese burger, fried egg, tomato, onion string and z-sauce) with a classic poutine done right.

The beef is juicy and flavourful, but not dripping with grease, like some places. Mark the owner tells me that he purposely set out to make decadent angus burgers, trying to keep it healthy, without sacrificing flavour.Their poutine is huge, featuring thinner fresh cut potatoes, double-fried and topped with legit fresh white cheese curds and delicious beefy gravy.  *Don't forget to check-in to take advantage of the 15% discount special.In a city where gourmet burger places are popping up every day, this is one of the good ones.

Black marble table tops and black metal chairs. The burgers are a 10 for taste, freshness, all fresh toppings and juiciness say both my daughter and I. My daughter loves the soft fresh sesame buns and wants to know where the owner buys them. The fries are the old fashioned hand cut fresh kind and yes, they do have malt vinegar as well as white vinegar, which ""chips"" IMO should have in a good burger place (daughter of an Englishwoman here). Quite reasonable prices. Single cheeseburger combo with a can of Coke or other soft drink $8.85. Add $1.00 for bottled pop. You order your burger & fries at the back counter and take your can/bottle of pop from the fridge opposite the counter. The owner says he's trying to cook things the old fashioned way and welcomes customer feedback. I wanted to try the dessert of the day but unfortunately all they had was Nutella milkshake, and I don't like Nutella.

Much better than 5 guys or other places (and much more inexpensive - everything is included in combo!).  Meat is superb, bun is the freshest and fries are homemade, non-greasy.   The eating area is also extremely clean and cheerful. I don't live in the area, happened to discover it when I was visiting a friend but will certainly be travelling here all the time - certainly worth it.	JB8-8TtNYX-vLqN7cz-zHA	5	2016-11-14	4	1

The z burger had delicious onion straws and all the ingredients were fresh. The texture of the patties were unlike any place I've ever been to, a must try!Also worth a mention, the fries are very tasty (not greasy like most places). I didn't get a chance to try the Z poutine but it sounds like perfection.	JB8-8TtNYX-vLqN7cz-zHA	5	2016-10-29	3	1

It was cooked perfectly with a nice fried eggs and their signature Z sauce is a much improved version of the Big Mac sauce. Their fries were a little bit bland, but still acceptable.

It's almost never crowded, and the people that come there generally are reading or studying.  They have an amazing tea collection, with equally good food and even grilled cheese sandwiches (with the option to add tomato :) )  One of the walls has some cute benches that are padded, making it a perfect place to wrap your hands around your warm cup of tea and read a book.  I agree with Rachel C, I wish they had high tea, that would make it perfect!  The only drawback is that it's small, and there aren't a lot of places to sit.  If you are the mood to try a variety of tea, or just need a place to study/relax this is it!	MKd_EUD0PG__cOfIbeqYAg	5	2011-12-20	1	0
1	TsBUWbhRhuiEMXb56kL0Cg	KiGRD0ZhuDF1K1xLc0jjGA	This place is ridiculously cute, colorful, and cozy, with a huge selection of loose leaf teas.  They offer teas by the pot only, except for iced teas (during warm months) which come by the cup.  They range from $3 to $4 per pot depending on how fancy the tea is.The staff here has been friendly every time I've been.  They are always keen on offering suggestions if you ask!  Last time, I was struggling between going for a fruity tea vs. a chocolatey tea, and the girl working suggested this chocolate peppermint tea blend that was not on the menu but that she had made for herself the other day.  I tried it, and it was AMAZING!My experiences with the food here (from at least a year ago) have been great as well.  They have their own pastries as well as a selection from a nearby bakery.  Savory offerings include grilled cheeses, soups, and sometimes specials.One small gripe I have is that their teapots tend to, for whatever reason or another, leak some tea leaves and residue when you pour into your cup.  I suspect it's because the filter is not super fine and so small bits from the tea mixture can fall through.  It's never been a major problem, though.You can always find fun, seasonal specialty drinks here too (e.g. hot apple cider in the fall), in addition to coffee, if tea isn't your thing.  Newspapers and reading materials are usually available to pick up, and there are board games in the back.  This is a great place for a rainy (or cold) day!	MKd_EUD0PG__cOfIbeqYAg	4	2012-11-01	2	1
0	Um2iec4NKMXVpJEME3PfKg	nGV40rXMRL_IN6lWpyrsmA	You can purchase from a huge variety of loose leaf teas. It's one of the few places I know that really pays attention to brew times and water temperature. The smoothies are fresh and taste very natural. If you order in, they'll give you your drink in a cup that looks smaller than if you order to-go. They have nice metal counters with lots of plug in places for your laptop. The benches aren't terribly comfortable, but the couches are. Plus, the people behind the counter are great!	MKd_EUD0PG__cOfIbeqYAg	4	2008-01-17	0	0
8	135DbbQnr3BEkQbBzZ9T1A	8FvVPvTaMJAM5drD18JxAA	I dropped by Te Cafe a week ago with CM to check out their offerings. As a tea lover, having passed it many times on Murray, I'd long been curious about it. My friends who live nearby never wanted to go, however, since they prefer Dobra Tea across the street. Last week, CM wanted to get a hot beverage in the area, and he was game for checking it out, so I was able to do so.When we went to order, the menu had loose leaf teas listed by type (columns) and by grade (rows), which determined their price.  While you can buy them by the cup, if you're with other people or you're planning on hanging out for awhile, it usually makes more sense to get a pot, since each pot provides 2-3 infusions, and hot water is free.  We decided on a pot of the milk (?) oolong ($4.50), recommended by the barista, which was on the lighter side and was quite pleasant.  Once we'd had a pot and refilled it with hot water for a second infusion, we also got a pesto grilled cheese sandwich with tomato as a snack ($4.75), which was crisp and super-flavorful (thanks for the recommendation, fellow Yelpers!), and complemented the tea well.My favorite part of Te Cafe, however, was the board games that can be found on the back shelf and front table.  Unfortunately, not all of them are complete, as CM and I found out when we picked up the Ultimate Scenario Game (?), but those that are make for a fun time!  We ended up playing dominoes--which I'd never played with as a game before (just setting them up in rows and knocking them down ;-) ). Since the first two games went quickly, with each of us winning one, we played best out of three. The last game went on to the point I thought we were going to run out of dominoes, but I eventually won.  Yay!While I understand my friends' preference for Dobra, given that they have a more extensive menu of tea and snacks and a more unique Asian tea house-like atmosphere, I enjoyed Te Cafe for a change of pace. I'd definitely return for another visit in the future to sample more interesting teas--and to play another round of dominoes!	MKd_EUD0PG__cOfIbeqYAg	4	2015-02-10	14	10

I didn't even look over  the tea selections because this café had me the minute I saw the featured drink listed on their outdoor sidewalk sign.  I thoroughly enjoyed sipping  my  hot cider tea drink on  the cozy corner seat near the window while reading and watching the world pass by.  Truly a good place to unwind and be refreshed.

There were about 5 other people working in here when my friend and I stopped in for lunch - and it's sad that this is rare - but everyone respected the fact that everyone else was working and stayed reasonably quiet.The sushi rolls were good and priced well for sushi. They were a good size too, which meant I ate just the right amount of food for lunch by ordering one roll with a seaweed salad.The best part for me was by far the service. Very friendly throughout my whole experience. As my friend and I were leaving, the people behind the counter even asked us if needed anything else.

1	BoUGdFkiU6EVsHGSvt-Uwg	5Lz5wCZiKd28fXYDV1p36A	With wireless internet and a relaxing ambience, this was a place I was looking for during my two years in grad school.  Coffeehouses in Pittsburgh often were too loud and rickety uncomfortable chairs.The owners are often attentive and bring a certain unique warmth to the place.  Sure, a large part of the cafe is devoted to them.I loved coming here for an after-dinner conversation with a friend or for studying.  Normally I would order a pot of darjeeling or a green tea.  Great selection of teas.  Very attentive service.  They give you a timer to help you remember how long to steep the tea.  The cups are all selected for the particular type of tea being served.When I was in the area, the cafe closed on Saturdays (being in Squirrel Hill), but I hear the hours may have changed.  Also, the owners seemed to have hired some of the younger crowd in the last few months which changed the pace somewhat.Still, when I visit Pittsburgh, I will return to this place.

It's sad that I don't come out here more often, now that I live here again...Anyway, they have a fantastic beverage selection (not just tea), high-quality loose-leaf teas you can buy by the ounce, comfortable enough seating, free wifi, and friendly staff.  The music's a toss-up; right now, it's some pretty good oldish rock, but apparently there is ""wispy Lillith fair crap,"" sometimes?  On the bright side, if you show up on a bad day, it is definitely quiet enough to allow you to just listen to your own on headphones.  And the clientele is pretty varied, which I also rather like."

I feel it.So here is the quick summary:-  Loose leaf teas served by the cup or pot at reasonable prices!  Cups of tea were around $2, and I got a pot of peaches and cream tea for $4.01 with tax.  The Cream Earl Grey is amazing as well!  There is also free hot water so you can keep going!- If you are not a hot tea drinker, there is also iced tea, lemonade, and hot chocolate!-They sell grilled cheese sandwiches with pesto for $4.50 ish.  I don't remember the exact price, but I remember that the pesto grilled cheese was amazing.-This place gets packed with wifi hogs.  You've been warned.I really like the vibe of this place.  It's a good place to catch up with a friend or study, and I like that it's on the quiet side of things.  They usually are out of most of the teas on the menu, but there are still at least 50 types.

The overall ambiance is very conducive to being productive: comfortable chairs, good lighting, a great selection of music at the appropriate volume, and of course the warm tasty beverages that are an absolute steal.  This place has the most robust hot chocolate lineup I have ever seen, with the Mexican chocolate being my favorite.  Free wi-fi, with no necessary password, makes things all the more convenient.

0	BKMP5NtMa-VqP_lnWjbOYw	gTYNjQmNvUC6cIKaYaRo2w	Amazing place to read or just relax, lots of loose leaf teas to choose from. Some of their lower priced teas aren't thrilling (especially the greens) but you get what you pay for. The only problem I see arising is, if you buy a pot which is the best deal, you get a neat tray that comes with a timer, a cup for drinking, and a cup to hold the used leaves. If you're drinking on your own or with a single friend, that's fine and dandy- but it's near impossible to have a proper meeting with three or more people without forcing everyone to use inefficient mugs instead. I might be mistaken but they really should have party tray type tea sets. Still, 5 stars for sure. Excellent service, eclectic music (classical one day, indie the next), good ambiance, good price, decent hours (I wish they would open a bit earlier, but they close so late that it makes up for it), and some really amazing teas mixed in. Free wifi makes it even better.	MKd_EUD0PG__cOfIbeqYAg	5	2011-09-21	0	0

I know there are a lot of nuances to the preparation, like everything else, that can give you a plethora of subtle variation that you wouldn't get if it was made incorrectly. However, I still can't stand paying for it.However, Te Cafe has a great selection of gourmet teas that make the stop worth it. It's the kind of stuff that, unless you were a tea connoisseur, you would never be tasting. Their menu is full of teas all with names that vary from mundane, to Japanese, to just plain odd. I've been to the Te Cafe a few times but last night I ordered the ""Kokeicha"". It's a kind of smokey green tea that you steep for 3 minutes. I tried to order a tea by the name of ""gunpowder"" but they were sadly out of it. The man behind the counter informed me that the ""Kokeicha"" was very similar.The tea was great and, honestly, even when something's not your cup of tea you have a fun experience. It's something you usually don't get to try on your own. Who would honestly buy 23 dollars worth of loose leaf tea that they've never tried? I'll leave it to the Te Cafe to let me sample them a pot at a time.Every time I enter the cafe the staff are friendly, accommodating, and most of all informative. They know their way around tea so someone who is completely ignorant, as I am, can get a little guidance. It's a fun place to relax and enjoy a beverage you usually wouldn't; how often do you drink gunpowder at home?"	MKd_EUD0PG__cOfIbeqYAg	5	2011-02-24	2	0

There are board games available for playing, but most people seem to either be there with one or two other people to chat, or on their laptops making use of the wi-fi. The staff is very knowledgeable about different kinds of tea, and if you need help picking something, will ask you questions to figure something out - green or oolong?  floral or fruity? - and then bring out several teas for you to smell before choosing one.  My favorite so far is the silk oolong, which is a smooth and slightly creamy oolong tea.  I also really like the tea cups they use for Chinese teas.	MKd_EUD0PG__cOfIbeqYAg	5	2009-08-11	0	0

In the winter, the windows are usually nice and foggy, providing the coziest feel when you're settling in with a hot cup of tea. They also have a nice selection of pastries and sushi, so you can snack or have a tasty meal while you're there to compliment your drink. Their chai tea latte is deeeeelicious as well, highly recommended! Great prices, great service, great food & drink :)	MKd_EUD0PG__cOfIbeqYAg	5	2017-01-18	1	1

The owners are also great, and bring a nice sense of community to Squirrel Hill when you walk in. I tried the Sushi here for the first time, and was surprised that they made it on site. You get a lot for $8-$9, and it tastes yummy. Would recommend. The mulled tea is my favorite though. I'll miss it in the summer.	MKd_EUD0PG__cOfIbeqYAg	5	2016-03-11	1	0

0	3EN4rQgpR8cR1NxuJNzi9Q	c_IJF6qqXY8f2wjPGt5EKA	I've come here twice and have to say their tea selection is fantastic. There are so many different kinds of teas and I appreciate the variety they offer in terms of food + ambiance + teas. I would give this place 5 stars but I am not a fan of their bubble tea. They microwaved the boba (they pre-make it and then put it in the fridge) and the flavor didn't even taste like tea. It was $4 and I don't feel like it was worth it. I was hoping it would be better since they do specialize in tea but I do realize that doesn't necessarily mean their bubble tea would be good since in my opinion that is a whole different category.I would come back strictly for their hot teas but definitely not the bubble tea.

1	cQpTkatAqnOBCarVNwixPQ	JB8Nwp6J-jX-jiQbWPfn3g	Every tea and tea-related concoction I have had here has been great. The atmosphere is bright and warm. They must have taken the other poster's music complaint into account, because I have heard a wide variety of great stuff every time I have been in there.The staff is always super-friendly (without being annoying) and the clientele is usually a good mix of studying students/laptop users and people actually having conversations.In short, good tea, good tea-related creations, good service, good music, good place to study or have a chat.

New age, strummy folky wispy Lilith fair crap every time. I still keep coming back from time to time when I have a tea craving but WOW.	MKd_EUD0PG__cOfIbeqYAg	3	2008-03-15	0	0
1	zh8-XfjqlwAxf--RS4azzg	RBEoSzBeoqAaEXfxYlrzRw	Even if you're not in the mood for something from Te Cafe's diverse tea selection, there are plenty of other drinks that satisfy: tea lattes, lemonades (both plain and with unusual flavors like ginger, lemonade and hibiscus), hot chocolates and more.  The pleasant staff is knowledgeable about its teas and can offer great recommendations.  The loose leaf tea is also sold, and some of the more unusual tea blends can make neat gifts for people.The atmosphere is calm enough that I can concentrate if I bring work to do.  It's also really helpful that in terms of food, Te Cafe offers more than sweets--while I loved baked goods, sometimes I need something more than sugar to fuel my noggin.  Grilled cheese sandwiches and vegetable soup are recent additions to the cafe's menu.  While the soup is clearly from the can, it and the grilled cheese are nourishing.  I definitely appreciate not having to pack up all my study materials and leave in search of a decent meal.  I really like the feeling of community that Te Cafe fosters with an area for posters and fliers for upcoming local events and work by local artists on the walls.  The cafe also hosts occasional poetry readings, but unfortunately I've never been able to attend one.	MKd_EUD0PG__cOfIbeqYAg	4	2009-11-07	2	0

The atmosphere is really nice and chill too- perfect for reading, sketching, studying, etc. I only wish there were more pastry/dessert options, other than just tarts and biscotti. It may actually be a good thing (for my wallet) though... haha.	MKd_EUD0PG__cOfIbeqYAg	4	2012-11-30	0	0

I have yet to find a better place to get good, loose leaf tea. The presentation is top notch and the variety is excellent.The atmosphere of this little tea shop cannot be described. I would stop by towards the end of the day to finish up some work. The relaxed setting and fairly quiet place made it easy to focus and get things done.I don't work in the area anymore, but I'll use any excuse to get back there.Seriously, it is worth fighting to find a parking spot in Squirrel Hill for this place.

0	8DclOINSPldMTgiEbuCdoA	0Hv-VzdIdn-oraQfIvBKCA	This place is super cute! I went here with my bestie (visiting from CBus) and she said it reminded her of Zen Cha, which I can see. You can order pots of tea, sushi, other drinks and real meals! We got a pot of their Apricot black tea to share. It had enough for about 2 refills and the set it came with was adorable! Taste was rich and fruity and made me want to go back for another flavor!My friend got their sashimi bowl and it looked awesome! It made a nice, light lunch for her and the price wasn't outrageous. I see that they have crepes too so will definitely have to drag the hubs here to order all new stuff! They also have some games in the back but I was happy just chatting with my friend in the laid back atmosphere. Some other reviewers mentioned this but the smell of this place really wasn't appetizing--must be due to the combo of fish + tea? The owners were nice enough but they don't start selling their savory dishes until after a certain time which was not listed on the menus. So don't come here too early on the weekends!

3	VwAhjZPN7zJuyG03P8mp_w	xUq3iv0vyx4_sAhPX4GQ4Q	I can't believe all this time I did not write a review for Té Cafe. Since I came to Pittsburgh 4 years ago, this place has been my favorite location for some serious work. Hmmm, maybe I didn't write the review because subconsciously I wanted to keep this little gem all to myself. They have an extended selection of teas though I usually just go for the easy option: the tea of the day. I've gotten their yerba mate every once in a while and I like that they tell you to properly time it at 5 minutes. Nowadays they make smoothies too though I personally haven't tried them (it's nice and quiet without the constant blender buzz). For snacks you can go with the grilled cheese sandwiches or some of the regular coffe shop sweets. Sometimes I complain about the lack of options in the snack department but I have to admit it seems wise to keep the food choices simple, after all you have more than 50 teas to chose from.If you're looking for a mellow place to work (with comfy chairs) and few people mostly working at their computers or reading their ipads this is the place for you. Side warning:  I love the comfy chair and I'll give you mean stares if you happen to occupy it :)	MKd_EUD0PG__cOfIbeqYAg	5	2012-06-23	5	2

It has a great, relaxing environment. Their lavender lemonade is great as is their plum berry white tea. I wish they had more room. The one thing they can definitely improve upon is their bathroom.

Every time I've been in, the staff's  been great with suggestions, samples, patience, etc. Went in again yesterday, and again...totally great. For being a clueless meathead, I was treated with no condescension, just the barista's enthusiasm for tea.  One of the good businesses in Squirrel Hill I'm happy to support.

0	OKUs_ZvoDYkgg-bFRfmHCg	rfqHyUT7f0mJIvB7qFQc3w	I recently  moved away from Pittsburgh, but this is one of the spots I miss the most. I spent many hours here working on my thesis, but also many hours here just hanging out with friends or reading a book. The people who work there are very friendly and very patient. When I first started stopping in, I knew very little about tea, and they always took the time to explain different properties of each type of tea and were able to make thoughtful suggestions for things they thought I should try based on my current mood and goals for the day.One of the best parts of this place is the insane selection they have. I felt like there was always something new to try. I loved the hot cider in the winter.The space was almost always neat and clean, including the bathroom. I enjoyed the little flowers they kept on the tables, and the music selection was what you would hope for in a cozy little tea shop. The atmosphere is inviting, and only rarely would it be too crowded to find a place to sit. The wi-fi was much more reliable than other places in the area.I love this place! If I ever make it back to Pittsburgh, I'm going to make it a point to stop in. Keep up the great work!	MKd_EUD0PG__cOfIbeqYAg	5	2014-07-07	1	1
0	uFinfsLRjbiEdiW1qgpRHQ	mp70-GC6K-GUWhr0zhMVzg	This is my favorite cafe in Pittsburgh. I'm not much of a coffee drinker, I prefer drinking tea or smoothies if I'm sitting at a cafe and Te Cafe is perfect for that. It's a very chilled out place, got big windows and all kinds of seating. It's not the fanciest cafe around, which is actually nice, because it has a very comfortable vibe to it. They have free and unlimited wifi. The ambience is great for doing your own thing, but I've also played board games there.They have all kinds of teas there. They have specials every day in each variety, and they give you a pot of it, which is around 2-3 cups. You can also order a pot of any loose leaf tea on the menu. Or, you can buy loose leaf tea as well. My all-time favorite is the Panetonne. It's a black tea with vanilla and orange, and just the right amount of it too. I also really like their Green Tea smoothie, they make it with Maccha powder. They make grilled cheese sandwiches and have some biscottis and muffins.Great place, check it out!

0	bryAPtwnnMYjbzoOWHzbWg	4MwWqMejF_5Lm3HJlPvjFA	I wouldn't have guessed that a tea cafe would sell sushi but my friend recommended to try this place. Ordered the Twin City Roll which had tuna, salmon, avocado, and cucumbers. There was more sushi than rice so the ratio was good. The sushi looked good and I thought the price was reasonable. But when I was eating it, the sushi didn't seem fresh. There was a strong fish smell and the aftertaste left a slimy feeling on my tongue. The interior of the cafe also had a weird smell... I don't know how to describe it exactly. I don't think sushi and tea smells go well together? I don't know if I would recommend coming here for sushi. Maybe their tea is better as it is a tea cafe.

0	KcFMI-hsr2Em7whfI4OM5g	7hqzqymiaqoo1QwWB2x38A	I've been shopping at this mall since I was a child and in the last couple years they've really outdone themselves by doing a total makeover and renovation. The whole interior is a lot more trendy and reflective of our times and the big name brands and boutiques that have settled in the Mail.Everything is a glossy white marble, clean and sleek.  Lots of natural sunlight coming from glass rooftop openings. The food court is also impressive, they've expanded the seating area by shutting down one of the stores on the side. Color combination and lighting makes this place a whole lot more appealing.Since the building of the Dix 30 mega outdoor shopping lifestyle complex, Mail Champlain has had to renew itself to retain shoppers. The opening of the Forever 21 store was one of their best moves. They also appeal to a higher class of shoppers with big brands like BCBG and Browns shoes. Even The Bay has undergone a slight revamp - on the main floor, they've rearranged their handbag and shoe department to make way for name brands.I used to see mostly elderly people wandering around during the week, it didn't seem like a popular hangout place for youngings but that has changed.Mail Champlain has a bit of everything for all ages, tastes and budgets. The only thing missing might be a pharmacy, they used to have a Jean Coutu but it closed down.	7q7RWPwljKtmX-fbSinuHw	4	2013-03-16	2	0

The food court is OK, not the best but the mall is cute and easy to navigate around. I love the Yves Rocher here, great little salon inside. Also the fact that there is a huge sirens store here which has way more variety than Dix30. When the weather is like today (raining) we end up at this indoor mall instead of the outdoor Dix30 and love the atmosphere here. It was the first mall I visited in Montreal so I hold many fond memories of the place :)	7q7RWPwljKtmX-fbSinuHw	3	2016-10-29	3	2

0	5JOP01e-jC-N3OrnevM7bA	DoOr0Vsn9cxwzU9M-HPQFQ	So I know Christy's is a Madison tradition with those lovely views of Lake Waubesa. But this place is a one-track pony... location, location, location. This is a family-owned bar/restaurant and the owners know they have a captive audience. The beer is cold and the food is average, but the service is atrocious. On a recent beautiful Saturday afternoon, there were only two servers for the outside seating area.  There's no host, so we (4 adults and 1 kid) sat at a picnic table and proceeded to wait at least 10 minutes to no avail. We eventually went inside to order drinks and lunch. At no time during our visit did a server ever approach our table. I'd certainly be inclined to write off this awful experience to a bad day or poor staffing, but unfortunately this is more the rule rather than exception. One really weird thing is the Friday Fish Fry that features a special menu available ONLY inside, this isn't communicated very well;  so you'll grab a table outside, wait to order only to learn you can only order from the pizza/sandwich menu.	xOx-N9G7AteZTnZfVFfNHA	2	2016-07-08	1	0

I guess it's Waypoint every time! As a side note: I'm writing this on a Sunday afternoon as I've been sitting at an outside table for over 15 minutes without one of the three servers currently working even acknowledging us! I really wanted the Shrimp Christy's. (Because it's fantastic!) Oh well. There probably won't be a next time either!	xOx-N9G7AteZTnZfVFfNHA	2	2016-08-14	1	0

After waiting more than 15 minutes for a server outside, I went inside to inquire of outdoor food service.  Of course, since I am not one of the regular inebriated bar flies, getting the attention of a bartender is nearly impossible.  I guess I'm just not loud enough, drunk enough, or both.  And once I did get his ear, the next local loudmouth douche bag stumbles up to the bar and interupts me to order his next round of Captain and Cokes (classy).  So we left and will never be back...unless of course we lose all sense of decency and purpose and relocate to McFarland.	xOx-N9G7AteZTnZfVFfNHA	1	2016-09-05	2	0

The sand is soft but at night, some of the lights will shine right in your face and obstruct your view while you're playing.There is a hose and area to rinse off afterwards, by the dock facing the beautiful, glistening Lake Waubesa.A cherry bomb will run you $7 and a Vodka 7 will run you about $5 or so.Be careful when you order the pizza, you start with either a 12"" ($8.99) or 16"" ($10.99) cheese and each topping is $1.50! My friends and I weren't aware of that and got a little carried away when we got our tab for all the drinks, pizza and wings was just under $100!On Monday nights they have a AYCE taco bar with ground beed and chicken, as well as assorted toppings. The pico de gallo was very fresh, the shredded romaine was crisp, and the salsa had a nice bite to it.

Ordered the nacho's and was fully disappointed-a somewhat small pile of flavorless corn tortillas and minimal cheese, chicken, peppers, and a clump of black olives. It appeared to have been placed briefly under a hot broiler as the top was charred and any buried shredded cheese was unmelted. The result was a very dry dish that required multiple cups of salsa to provide flavor and moisture.Note: This review was written during the summer of 2014 but I just found it in my Drafts-- sorry for the delay!	xOx-N9G7AteZTnZfVFfNHA	2	2015-02-03	1	0

Food was bland an uninspired.  What the waitress offered as the special was not what was delivered.  After we asked, she still didn't know what was included with the dinner.  Walleye sandwich was just OK.  Service was on the slow side too; one server for the entire 2 floors.  The lady tried hard, so she earned a good tip.  The kitchen and management could do a lot better.  Probably will not go here again for dinner.  Too bad because we do like the place overall.	xOx-N9G7AteZTnZfVFfNHA	2	2012-02-27	1	0

It started with the bartender getting our drink order wrong, One member of our party received a different potato than ordered, 1 had a different salad dressing than ordered and I had the worst fish fry EVER. It could have been good if the breading wasn't soggy on one piece and excessively crispy with holes in it (looked exactly like a funnel cake!). The baked potato tasted dry and leftover. The one high point was a waitress (first night on the job) that was very friendly and actually cared about our poor experience. Christy's is back on my list of places to avoid.	xOx-N9G7AteZTnZfVFfNHA	1	2011-07-16	2	0

He was unfailingly polite and friendly, as were the people who sat near us. It made me wish we had more time to hang out and soak up the lovely waterfront location. Starving, we ordered a pizza and both enjoyed enjoyed the hell out of it. The toppings tasted very fresh and the crust had a slight flakiness to it. The only drawbacks I can think of are the plastic cups the beer is served in and that I'd love it if another taphandle were devoted to something a bit more local to Madison, like Ale Asylum, Karben4, or even Tyranena (from Lake Mills).As we left Tim thanked us for stopping in and asked us to come back the next time we were nearby. I 100% plan to do so.	xOx-N9G7AteZTnZfVFfNHA	4	2013-08-09	1	2

Since it's on the lake, were not surprised there was a wait, but didn't really seem to be enoughpeople waiting for 1-1/2 hour wait.  We sat on the deck with a couple of drinks, and enjoyed that. At the 1-1/2 hour mark, went in to see how much longer and were shocked to see the mostly empty dining area in the bar. Maybe the upstairs dining was busy? Nope- one table of 4 waiting to be served, and 2 large tables of people who had finished eating and were doing their party speeches. We think they just forgot us.Brief wait for the waitress.10 minutes later got our salads for 2 of us, soup for 2  (husband wanted cole slaw, but they were out). Soup was good. Salad was very small, with a huge carrot 'coin' and cucumber slice. italian dressing was blah, bleu cheese dressing had no bleu cheese chunks.30 minutes later, caught the attention of our oblivious waitress to check on the status of our order, and her comment was ""didn't they tell you it would be an hour wait?"" Wouldn't that be the waitress' job? After another 20minutes, and the 1 hour mark, i went to find a manager. Bartender blew me off, so I went to find the host,who apologized, said it was coming out now, and said they ""were just catching up"". From what? The bar area dining was almost empty, and we were still one of two 4 person tables up in the big dining area.5 minutes later, with no waitress, no food, we left. We will not be back. Maybe the food is good, can't comment on that, but the aggravation is not worth it."	xOx-N9G7AteZTnZfVFfNHA	1	2013-06-20	1	0
0	QDzMM2YcB0LDLJVHDqrz3g	NyWxv3NWZGkRym94DN8jOA	I've been here a few times. The cheese curds and fries are nice. Onion rings ok.  Wings my kids love but I think they are too smothered in sauce. Each time I've been here It was by boat so we've sat out side. I would have rated it a 3 or 4 except each and every table has an ash tray which is gross and they allow smoking in the entire area. My kids 6 and 11  were with us and one has asthma so we had to move to get out of the smoke. Very inconsiderate allowing smoking, only 3 out of maybe 40 people were smoking so maybe inconvenience 3 people and not everyone else. Going forward Ill probably just get takeout.	xOx-N9G7AteZTnZfVFfNHA	2	2017-06-11	0	0

Tonight we went back and our experience was the opposite. The lobster bisque was cold ( Apparently, they forgot to turn the burner on and we were the first to mention it. We were there at 8:00pm.). The fish was okay and the waffle fries were cold. My husband asked why we didn't get any bread. He was told that they ran out. We found that interesting since people who were seated after we were had bread. Not sure we need to go back.	xOx-N9G7AteZTnZfVFfNHA	1	2015-08-01	1	0

This was the last time though. When we arrived we where told we needed to wait 5 to 10 mins for a seat. After 15 mins we where seated in a room with 10 open tables (not sure why we needed to wait).  About another 15 mins went by and 2 other tables where seated and served drinks and still no one waited on us.  No one ever did so we left. The other times that we have been the food is only mediocre for bar food at best.	xOx-N9G7AteZTnZfVFfNHA	1	2014-07-18	4	0

The waffle fries were delicious, wraps were average and a little pricey, and service was fair (even in the off season). Can definitely see the appeal during the summer but it won't be a place I seek for good eats and drink.	xOx-N9G7AteZTnZfVFfNHA	3	2017-04-09	2	0

If you're a craft beer lover like myself, you'll be disappointed in their beer selection, but Christy's is worth a visit solely for their fish fry.	xOx-N9G7AteZTnZfVFfNHA	3	2010-08-08	1	0

Overlooks the lake and many people dock their boats and enjoy the patio and food.   Lots of people taking food back out onto their boats.  Upon arriving, there is no sign telling you to sit down or see the hostess for a seat.  We walked around and into the bar and then we finally were told by the bartender that we can sit where we want.   The menus at the table were all different.   Three different menus, one omitted the burger and the other one didn't have the ""baskets"" on it.  Weird!!  The waitress knew that something was wrong with the soda guns and brought us 2 pitchers of essentially colored water.  When we finally mentioned it, she acknowledged that they were having problems with it.  After a while she brought us another one and said she hoped it was better.  It finally was.   The orange and lemon peels thrown on the grass, could be cleaned up as well.  Overall, the food was good.   Burger was juicy and flavorful and he bacon wrapped shrimp was really yummy.  The pizza at the table next to us looked delish and may be ordered if we return. The place has some potential but a little makeover would be great!!!"	xOx-N9G7AteZTnZfVFfNHA	3	2015-07-06	2	0

Les did a combination of multiple modalities on me including lymphatic drainage, chiropractic massage, Russian massage to realign my leg and foot.  I was very relaxed and even when he had to use more pressure on the reflexology, it was fine.  He diagnosed that I had a tight inner thigh muscle and he got it to release.  Les is so experienced and can read your body and diagnose where your physical issues are.  I am telling all my friends about his work!	n5pocJmLE0vI3uskJcZIFg	5	2013-02-01	2	0

The first time I wasn't sure what to expect so I got a Ceasar Salad hold the Ceasar please. It was okay, the chicken was good and none of the leafy greens were in bad condition. I guess I was expecting a wow factor when it came to the $6 salad I had received. they do brew Starbucks so I had decided to get one of my favorites. Hazelnut latte... only they were out of the Hazelnut Syrup. I instead got a caramel latte. Not my favorite, but it would do.My second visit I was very excited to try one of their specialty sandwiches the Deluxe Roast Beef Press (only with 9 grain instead of sourdough) ! However when I arrived they had run of or roast beef, but I was told they were expecting their shipment to arrive tomorrow. Still hungry and not wanting to wait till tomorrow to eat I decided to try the Vegetarian Delight. $8.00 later my meal was... okay. Good sized, but in the end not what I was really hoping for when I had first came.Today I went to give it one more try. I got the Sandwich ""your way"" which I ordered Roast Beef, imported Swiss, on 9 grain with Lettuce and Spicy brown mustard. I also got a huge chocolate chip cookie and a Caramel Macchiato to wash it down. A total that came to $13.38. I arrived at my office and to my surprise my 9 grain bread turned into Sourdough - My least favorite bread... To say the least I really wanted to like this place, but I am not blow away by The Lunch Lounge. I have given them a 3 for effort. - Also to add I found out this last visit that they only have soup on Tuesday's"	_mqUzNXs_sJ1EJYgYZYszg	3	2012-02-03	0	0

It is a sunny day at 74° but it's clear that's it's Friday at the office.Anyway back to the food-Choices for breads cheese meats veggiesChips and soda Pretty standard with more selections available tooSandwich was well prepared and tasted as expected.Note: Almost gave them four stars because the cashier is a Colts fan but we all make choices and their good service and food shouldn't suffer from his choice to root for the Colts.

By then, I didn't have time to return to have them make me a new one.This is an expensive place for just sandwiches only.  My Panini alone was over $8 after tax.

It's kind of hidden from the street behind the Radisson on 44th St, but that didn't stop me from taking the short walk over from the hotel. Cute little place with great service and good eats! They have all kinds of sandwiches and salads, and couldn't decide what I wanted since the menu looked so good. They serve Boar's Head meats, which makes for an awesome sandwich. My friends who were staying with me raved about the food and said they wanted to come here for lunch again tomorrow. Only not so great thing was that they were out of the soup of the day, which we wanted to try, but since we did come about a half hour before they closed I could live with that.

The Italian sub was loaded with meat - just like back home (Boston) - salad was fresh, bread was fresh, meat was just YUMMY!! Nice surprise - we will all be back. BTW - lunch for 4 + drinks was $30.00 ... Great, clean, fresh and friendly!!	_mqUzNXs_sJ1EJYgYZYszg	5	2015-12-20	0	0

Has about 12 or so tables inside with 3 tables outside. Typical clients are business execs and tradespeople on lunch break. No issue getting a table or parking space. Little difficult to find though.Food: Great selection of sandwiches. Quality meats and fresh veggies. I like the southwest chicken chipotle sandwich. Also excellent salad menu. They also have a great breakfast menu but I've never been there for breakfast.Service: Fast service, able to move the lunch rush pretty well.Overall: Great little lunch cafe!	_mqUzNXs_sJ1EJYgYZYszg	4	2016-08-04	1	0

The Chicken Fiesta Wrap is my favorite (I CRAVE it) and the California Club is really good too (crispy bacon....yummmm). If you can get there before they run out of Tortilla Soup it is outstanding. The food is always consistent and they don't seem to cut corners. Reasonably priced for what you get and what's in the area.

Meat was tender, taste was good and no overpowering sauces. Its a bit cramped in there so a togo order is a good idea, but its close to my other office so it makes for a perfect stop. Service was fast considering the crowd at lunch and the patrons and employees seemed to know one another.Its a nice place if you are in the area, stop by and have lunch!	_mqUzNXs_sJ1EJYgYZYszg	3	2015-07-31	0	0

0	ktdSILM4nVCPAzVVVQmB_w	XcARF3jBueZcmXNyfr6gNQ	I feel like this place has gotten worse over time, and it feels as every time I try to go back, they fail to meet the mark somehow. I used to frequent it when my work first moved into this area, about 4 years ago, but I think today was the draw for me. They forgot to include dressing with my $9 salad. Also, without the dressing, the chicken has a strange taste, almost questionable, which makes me wonder how it has tasted in the past...at least I got extra spinach. The initial reason I started going here less often was a noticeable decrease in their salad sizes a few years back, hence I ask for extra spinach. One good thing they have going for themselves is that the veggies they use in their salads always taste fresh, for that reason I gave them two starts instead of one. However, I expect better for the price they ask for their food. Today was my last visit and I will make sure to spread the word at work.	_mqUzNXs_sJ1EJYgYZYszg	2	2017-01-10	0	0

I had several expensive meals during my trip, but nothing was as tasty as my Lunch Lounge experience!  I made sure I had time for a breakfast stop on my way back to the airport., and was again wowed with a huge breakfast burrito, great latte and a smile - all for less than my daily NYC latte and muffin.  My  client has never been to The Lunch Lounge, so next time I am in town, we have a lunch date at the best undiscovered charming cafe in Phoenix!

When I walked In and the older woman standing there took about 5 minutes to acknowledge that I was standing there at the counter waiting to be served..Finally she said ""whenever your ready.."". I told her hi how are you, giving her a nice reminder that that is how your supposed to greet new customers in your establishment. That on its own turned me off because I hate giving my money away tobusinesses that don't appreciate me.  I don't feel like I am asking for much in exchange for coming back and supporting local businesses. As I was standing waiting for my food I overheard the employees (including my o so pleasnt serve lady) complaining about the groupons that kept coming in.. while I was standing there! Rude! The older man behind the counter making sandwiches was very nice. He is the only reason I am giving two stars. The food on the other hand was decent.

The owner took my order a few weeks back and recommended the Stromboli since I always ordered the Roast Beef Press (which is fantastic!). O. M. G... the Stromboli is the best sandwich I've ever had. Inside out sub roll, pesto, ham, pepperoni, salami, cheese, and cherry peppers - toasted on a panini press. Seriously? On my day off from work, I drove 30 minutes back there to take family there for lunch. If they served dinner, I'd have to think about moving closer.	_mqUzNXs_sJ1EJYgYZYszg	5	2015-01-28	0	0

Whether it is breakfast or lunch you can't go wrong with trying this place for a simple, but gourmet, breakfast sandwich or a dressed up salad for lunch. I only gave them four stars for this type of venue because I felt they were a bit understaffed when I arrived around 10am. Don't hold this against them. It was a bit of a wait for a sandwich but the quality is well worth the wait. The dill on the breakfast sandwich was a nice touch. The outdoor seating was nice on a cool morning.	_mqUzNXs_sJ1EJYgYZYszg	4	2014-03-25	2	0

On busy nights like Friday and Saturday they have run out of certain items.  I don't know how authentic the food is but it is on par with other Caribbean spots in town.

0	9IRuYmy5YmhtNQ6ei1p-uQ	75wHJ12WyXoxmpQ6fFFlQQ	Golden Krust is a bakery first and their specialty is the patty, and other baked goods, they also serve Jamaican staples such as oxtails, fish, jerk chicken, and curry chicken with all the fixins(rice and peas, plantains, and veggies), Ting, and other Jamaican drinks. With that said, if you're looking for patties look no further because they're simply the best ever! Buttery, flaky, fat-laden pastry, filled with chicken, beef or shrimp! Yes, it is a chain and the patties are shipped in but they're baked in house daily and trust me they're addictive! Now, the food overall has been fresh and pretty solid, but over the years it has been a tad inconsistent, but everyone has a bad day so I haven't held that against them. I had my very first oxtail here several years ago and I've been ordering them ever since, but I must say my favorite is still the curry chicken. The oxtails and curry chicken are both seasoned just right with plenty of gravy.........it's all about the gravy. I know most people think of jerk chicken when coming to Jamaican restaurants but since I'm not a jerk type of chic, I can offer no insight on that entree:-) Golden Krust has been serving up solid Jamaican food in Charlotte for years and though there are other decent Caribbean spots in the city, I continue to return to the Krust.......	wtazPNyIbsRMHmrpEYbqZA	4	2011-03-15	4	0

If you don't have high expectations for service or want to be ""wowed"" with food, you won't be too disappointed.On both occasions, I've had the dinner combo ($8-$10).  The food itself is pretty good.  I had the Jerk Chicken and the Curry Goat, both of which were not too spicy. The plates are served with generous helpings of rice and red beans and another side, usually steamed cabbage or collards.  The meat portions was kinda slim.  But the service?  A total take-a-number-and-wait-for-me-to-move attitude pervades this place.  The line was long and the staff were slow to move.  Geez!My buddy and I sat in the back dining hall, which they closed off with a wet floor sign as they were closing in an hour.  RUDE!  I had to walk around it to get a drink refill.  If you want cheap Caribbean food for takeout, this might be a OK place.

The food is always tasty and never really found that service was an issue until my last visit.I had a Jamaican visitor and she want hard dough bread to go with our dinner. Now I could have gone a couple of different places but I chose the Bakery. I love this bread but I typically only eat it when in NY, Jamaica or Florida because I need my hard dough to be as fresh as possible. While the seemingly nice woman was ringing me up I politely asked ""how old is the bread?"" Now I know this is called a bakery but everyone knows their baked goods are shipped in. She responds by saying ""the bread is fresh."" I say your idea of fresh and mine maybe 2 different things. She became a maniac but in a calm way. She asks: do you want the bread or not? At the time I really just needed to get the bread and leave, dinner was waiting. But not before I explained that as a consumer and patron of this store I have a right to know how old something is in a darn bakery that doesn't bake anything.  After the fact, i was very upset because I could have gone somewhere else, and for her think that it was OK to respond in that manner bothered me. Why was she so combative in the first place? In the end, she told me their shipments come every Tuesday. So this would be the best day to visit if you need baked goods. I myself, will never spend another nickel there."	wtazPNyIbsRMHmrpEYbqZA	2	2014-09-11	3	0

They're not going to offer it to you either. The food tastes horrible. I wish I could sit outside and turn people around to save their souls. But unfortunately this is all I can do. Take heed and go elsewhere!!!!!	wtazPNyIbsRMHmrpEYbqZA	1	2012-09-23	1	0

The Jamaican patty had such a crispy, well put together crust. It was probably the best Jamaican patty I've ever had. If you're in the Charlotte area & you like Caribbean food, it's definitely a spot to look into.	wtazPNyIbsRMHmrpEYbqZA	4	2017-04-19	0	0

Walking into the restaurant it was extremely humid and hot so I assume the air condition was not working. My family and I proceeded to order since we were starving. We ordered the Curry chicken with rice and beans and cabbage, Oxtails with rice and beans and cabbage and Jerk Chicken with rice and beans and cabbage. We also added 2 spicy beef pattys, they did not have any more regular beef pattys, I was disappointed. With it being so hot in the restaurant I wanted a Large ice water BUT their fountain drink machine was not working and they did not have any bottle waters. The only drinks that were available were bottled juices that I was not interested in. So I walked over to Shane's to buy a large drink. After returning with my large drink in hand my family and I ate dinner. The curry chicken was my favorite out of all the entrees we ordered but I was disappointed in my plantains were very soggy and not fried long enough. The oxtails disappointed me the most. They were not seasoned and did not really have a taste. Overall my experience here was just ok, I hope Golden Krust improves the obvious issues and bring back the original Golden Krust.	wtazPNyIbsRMHmrpEYbqZA	2	2016-07-26	1	1

I'm from Brooklyn, so I'm used to having maximum food for a great price. Not so in Charlotte, for the minimal amount of oxtail, the price could be a bit lower. There is no reason to pay a high price for lots of rice and cabbage but a scoop of oxtail. I'm definitely not expecting oxtails to dominate the plate, but the serving my daughter had was enough to convince me I won't be getting anything other than beef patties here. That is, when they actually have any available.	wtazPNyIbsRMHmrpEYbqZA	3	2015-12-22	6	2

I met some friends here after work based on their recommendation. When we got there, it was empty (this was around 5:30 on a Monday evening) but definitely picked up as time passed.This was my first time eating Jamaican food (I know!) and I wasn't all that hungry so I hemmed and hawed over the menu for a little bit. I went with the spicy chicken Jamaican patty and a pineapple-flavored Jamaican soda. There's a case of bottled Jamaican sodas or cans of American sodas (coca-cola, pepsi, or mountain dew). FYI - they don't always have all of the patties listed on the menu available to order so just ask before you get too committed to a particular flavor. The woman went into the back and came right back out with my patty. Nice and warm, ready to eat.I went into the back seating area while my friends finished placing their orders. The patty was a fluorescent yellow color which threw me off a little bit but when I bit into it, my fears were long forgotten. The patty crust was flaky and had a little bit of a sweet flavor that balanced the mild heat from the meat inside. The Jamaican soda was very sweet, which should come as no surprise since its second ingredient is high fructose corn syrup. It's definitely not anything I would probably have again but it was good enough to wash down my patty. I got to taste a bit of my friends' meals and I really, really enjoyed the jerk chicken. The chicken was juicy and extremely flavorful. It's definitely some I would order on my next visit. Also, the coco bread was/is a winner.Overall, a good spot to get your introduction to Jamaican food and/or to indulge your already long-held affection.	wtazPNyIbsRMHmrpEYbqZA	3	2015-07-22	1	0

You should definitely check it out at least once if you find yourself in the University Area.It's small and tucked away in the shopping center, but you visibly see the sign for the place.  The menu isn't that big, so you for sure will not be overwhelmed with too many choices.  I have gone here twice now and definitely recommend the Goat Curry or the Oxtail meal.  I don't know about you, but when I ordered these, I also asked for extra gravy.  It was great to have the extra gravy with the rice and cabbage. Note that when you order the meal, it doesn't come with a drink though.  Kinda a bummer on that part. The place is alright, pretty small.  They have tables near the register, and also near the back.  I haven't been towards the back to see how many tables there are as I have only gotten take out.  The prices are a little pricey to me, but the food was worth it.	wtazPNyIbsRMHmrpEYbqZA	3	2013-05-02	1	1

I must admit there was a decline in the food quality about a year ago due to a change in chefs. I did stop coming during that time. I stopped in about a week ago to give it another try. I spoke to the owner and the pleasant staff and found out they have a new chef which they gave rave reviews. I was pleasantly surprised that the were indeed correct. I food was scrumptious  just as I remembered!! Keep up the good work!! I'll be back and I'm putting the word out.	wtazPNyIbsRMHmrpEYbqZA	5	2016-11-07	0	0

They've lost me and numerous family members. I wonder if they changed management or something because their portion sizing are horrendous! Theyve scaled back so much and still charge the same thing! I'm not paying for Styrofoam! Then if you ask for more rice you get told ""no!""  What kind of service is that?! I got a whole lot of gravy though! Ugh theyre rude too! Now the food Id rate a 4...maybe 3.5. But the service and portions a 1. Shame I stopped getting plates and stuck to beef patties but then they stopped serving cheese beef and never bothered to have them again or remove it from the menu.

3	uT-yzDkY79szXYNWk7zDzQ	3IZqYKXIG7qmPr1wgxeKKg	Love this place for spicy patties! The patties are worthy of 6 stars, the only reason I gave the 4 stars is because every time I visit the music is blaring and the air conditioning seems to be turned off or not working. They have a dining area, but I can't imagine eating here. And be prepared for a wait, if you have been to the Islands then you know the slower pace you have to get used to. I have tried several of their curry dishes, the goat was my favorite. And if you're looking for a cold bottle of Ting or a piece of rock cake, this is your place. Did I mention the spicy patties? Wow, they are delicious. Growing up in Miami, we had a favorite place to go for patties. Here in Charlotte, this is our favorite place. I usually pick up 6, and I'm sure they would hold up fine for a couple of days in the fridge. They never last that long.	wtazPNyIbsRMHmrpEYbqZA	4	2016-06-17	6	6

42	Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA	Oxz26pqpIb7dDVeuUzNZlg	We had originally planned on eating at the Sinaloa food truck across the street, but they had a really long line, so we decided to give Mi Pueblo Taco Shop a try. Walking inside I was greeted by a sweet young girl who also took my order and she was nice about going over the menu and what the specials included. Inside was clean and decorated nicer than I expected. There was also a good amount of customers eating inside which I took as a good sign. I noticed they had different daily specials on the windows out front and they are totally worth checking out. I was here on a Friday and the special that day is 2 enchiladas, beans, rice and a drink all for $5.95 before tax. Great deal! The rice was lacking a bit on flavor and while the beans could have used more cheese, they did taste good and I liked the few tortilla chips on top of them. The enchiladas had a decent amount of cheese inside and the sauce tasted good. I'd for sure come back for this special again.Al Pastor Taco ($1.75) - The tacos come meat, onion and cilantro. There's a salsa bar with veggies and containers. I grabbed some of the red and green sauce and favored the green. My taco was filled nicely and had great flavor. Carne Asada Burrito ($5.99) - Here's where things got odd for me. Hubby and I intended to share this and he always prefers just meat, cheese and sour cream in his burritos. The girl who took our order said he couldn't have it that way and that the burrito had to have beans and rice inside. If the burritos aren't pre-made this shouldn't be a hard request at all. I saw a different girl putting meat on the grill and then put the burrito together, so I can't figure out why the burrito couldn't be customized to have the rice and beans left off. The burrito was a nice size for the price and did taste good, but it would have been better enjoyable if it could have been made the way preferred. Great weekly deals and decent Mexican food. I'd come back.	OQcvO5P3gH0cuJ-bPXwfQQ	4	2017-06-20	66	67

Reminded me a little of Texas, in terms of quality. Enchilada was very tasty, great sauce. Rice and beans were both delicious. Chile Relleno needed a tiny bit more flavor, but had plenty of cheese. Great little salsa bar. Had a bite of gf's Huevos Rancheros and we agreed that they were pretty awesome. We'll be back soon.	OQcvO5P3gH0cuJ-bPXwfQQ	4	2015-08-01	4	2

I was craving authentic tacos, as i reminisced on my favorite taco shop in san francisco.      First stop was Cardenas. It was closer to me but the lines were ridiculous and the environment chaotic. Needless to say, i left in search of greener pastures. Second stop, the las vegas chain Rigos tacos. The place gave me a creepy vibe plus their soda machine was not working. I'm all for hole in the wall places but this place was too much.     As I drove aimlessly i came across this place, Mi pueblo Taco shop. Boy was I pleasantly surprised!! my  long search of a mom & pop taco shop proved fruitful. The lady at the counter and the cook turned out to be husband and wife, and the owners. They were both extremely friendly  and the food was delicious!! they had weird pricing quirks but hopefully they figure it out. overall, 5 stars and will definitely come back again.

1	cQzo2WX1TyPEmS5jPzOUoA	sG2U7rH5NSTYR3-DumVT7w	TLDR: Lunch Specials; salsa bar available; excellent service; subpar food; convenience charge for card paymentI was really craving excellent chips and salsa so I usually have a go-to spot for Mexican fare. Learning that they were closed, I found something in the area with excellent reviews and was happy to find this location with a Yelp check-in.  I skimmed the reviews and saw several 4/5 star reviews with a couple of 2 star reviews so I decided to give this place a shot. Service was excellent and I was impressed with the politeness and grammar used in both English and Spanish upon walking in and ordering. It reflected that the business cares about the customer and how they are perceived when spoken to by the various clientele. I immediately placed an order for the chips and beans and was happy to see breakfast items on a menu. My foodie friend ordered a pastor burrito and I ordered chilaquiles with green sauce. Unfortunately, this is where I should've listened to the 2-star reviews. While I believe that the food is made fresh in-house, the quality lacks and pales in comparison to the service. The beans lacked flavor, excluding the cotija cheese and the chips were stale. This is probably a storage issue. The salsa were flavorful, but lacked spice. Interestingly enough, the green salsa was the spiciest. My friends pastor burrito was just ok. Not fantastic, not terrible. Just ok. It probably is similar to Roberto's, my terrible baseline for Mexican food flavor and service. My chilaquiles were tragic. The rice was pretty bad and the green sauce was pretty boring. It's sad to say that Del Taco has better rice, beans, and green sauce. Needless to say, I didn't enjoy the dish and I won't return anytime soon.	OQcvO5P3gH0cuJ-bPXwfQQ	2	2017-07-15	2	0

I told him Yelp and that I was in the area for a school assignment and lived across town.  He never heard of Yelp and didnt know that his place has a 5 star rating.  He was wearing an SD cap and I found out he lived in San Diego.  If you ever had authentic San Diego Mexican food you know this place is legit, because it reminded me of that.  I found this to be a unique experience with genuinely nice restaurant owners not catering to Yelp reviewers.  Hopefully that won't change after my random stop there.I had a carnitas burrito, cachete taco and carne asada taco, and a horchata (no not Smart Chata).  Overall the carne asada was the most flavorful with a nice charred taste.  The cachete was tasty.  My carnitas burrito was good too, similar to the SD burritos I miss.  Tortilla, meat, rice, beans, and since I'm originally from San Francisco I added some sour cream with guacamole.  The salsa was also fresh and tasty.	OQcvO5P3gH0cuJ-bPXwfQQ	5	2016-11-03	3	3

Everything I had was simply delicious and would go out of my way to venture in this neighborhood for Tacos and Mexican foodThe cashier/server was very friendly and asked if it was my first time here. She answered my questions and made me feel welcomed. I originally was going to order Tacos only but the enchilada combo grab my attention and got the combo with a single order of Carne Asada Taco on the side because I had to get a taco too. When the order finally arrived at my table. I got the three different salsas that was available at the salsa bar. From the first bite of my taco and enchiladas 1-beef & 2-chicken combination along with the fresh salsas. Every bite was amazingly flavorful and authentic.

This place ROCKS! Totally authentic mexican food. The tacos and flautas are legit and hit the spot dead on. We are mexican and we know our cuisine and you can't go wrong eating here. Just stop reading this review and try it. Like now.  Go!	OQcvO5P3gH0cuJ-bPXwfQQ	5	2017-06-16	1	1

A nice older couple seem to run the restaurant. The prices are fair, it's probably not not in the best part of N. Vegas but worth trying out, we'll be back.	OQcvO5P3gH0cuJ-bPXwfQQ	5	2017-05-05	0	0

Was really disappointed, expected a lot based on the reviews I read. You're better off going to a taco truck. I really hate how over priced tacos are now. Wouldn't mind paying $2-3, but at least give me what I'm paying for.	OQcvO5P3gH0cuJ-bPXwfQQ	2	2017-05-05	0	0

I have had every single meal available here, and I NEVER once had anything that was bland or stale. They Cook everything fresh, despite what others think. Even though I'm guessing those people have never seen the cooks in action. This place is 1 IN A MILLION! I've been going since they've opened in 2008. I have never regretted going there. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PLACE AND THE OWNERS! It's such a shame when people check in on here to get free food and THEN POST NEGATIVE REVIEWS ABOUT THE FOOD THAT THEY ACTUALLY HAVE TO PAY FOR LOL.

Here's how the convo went:Her: do you eat them [carne asada fries] every day?  Me: well, no...Her: then they're not so bad thenMe: good pointSalsa bar was on point and the spicy carrots and onions were crispy and super hot.  Yum.	OQcvO5P3gH0cuJ-bPXwfQQ	4	2016-12-01	2	2

1	FEwPxhjdVKxSPVQQAHX2gg	qbkhfoOAP43YREAH2t-PTQ	I really liked the 'mom and pop' feel of this little Mexican restaurant, and the quality of the food was really good. Solid four stars. The complimentary chips and beans I got for my Yelp check-in were excellent. I upgraded to a larger size beans in order to share. You can tell these beans are the real thing.... slow cooked with love for the flavor and not smashed too much. Yum.My husband has the carne asada burrito, it was huge, their version came with rice and beans inside the burrito, a little different than other taco shops I have been to.I had the combination plate, Chicken Enchilada, Chiles Relleno, and Chicken Taco. This plate came with rice and beans. Everything was excellent, but the star of the show was the taco!My next visit I will definitely try some of the other tacos on the menu. The salsas in the salsa bar were amazing, I put it on everything!So here is the bad news about this place........ the neighborhood! This shopping center and parking lot is scary! There are so many people loitering in front of the next door liquor store. I am glad I was with my husband, I really would not have felt safe coming here without him and coming here after dark.......

And we found it here. The food is very authentic because they know how to build the meal with a great foundation. The chips and homemade tortillas are to die for. We all had various tacos, chicken and asada. Their burritos are huge!  The best part of the meal was the carnitas nachos. Don't miss out on them.

While I was mystified at first, it quickly wore off. It kind of became of game of laughing at all the ridiculous things you can stick a logo on (would you like some novelty cups to go with your keychain??) However, the fact of the matter is that people do buy them so obviously there is a market for these things. I actually saw someone at the airport on his way out of Toronto carrying a giant Washington Capitals ""Man Cave"" sign that they had purchased at the store. I didn't exactly walk out empty-handed either (because who doesn't need a Harvey the Hound figure to sit on their desk??)All of that being said, the store is well laid out and staffed by friendly, helpful employees, all of whom are enthusiastic to talk about hockey (or at least good at faking it!)"	rPiS3Vt3usEE8tkDQNrObg	3	2015-01-13	0	0

Anyway, if you have a friend that into that... and he/she might enjoy something from here... But if you are from out of town hockey fan visiting, you will be really impressed to see all these hockey related merchandise all under one roof!

Dosas were made from chickpea and rice flour (i.e. not authentic). But all restaurants here use this method rather than actually soaking ""washed urad dhal"" and rice and then grinding them and allowing it to ferment (have a bit of a sour flavour which I love). Sambar was warm but the idlis and vardas and other dishes were cold. Sambar tasted okay. Three types of chutneys as well as lemon pickle. I liked the hoppers dish."

I took my family here (12 people) after calling ahead and being ensured that there would be minimum wait time. When we reached here the line was out of the door but we were told it wouldn't take long. After 45 mins(!!!) of waiting we finally got a place to sit. We were happily looking forward to some tasty masala dosas. Well that's the first thing your order at a Dosa place right? Well guess what, they ran out of potatoes.... You can have a palak paneer dosa sir, our server said. Well I didn't come here and wait 45 mins to eat a palak paneer dosa. We walked and instead of having a nice time at dinner, we ate greasy Domino's pizza instead. Interestingly upon further investigation, I discovered some older reviews with the same experience. I wish I had read them before. At this point I don't want to set foot in at least this location of Saravana Bhavan. I might consider giving the Scarborough location another shot. With so many options around, please do yourself a favor and go to some other South Indian place in Mississauga where they don't run out of potatoes....	TFDT0ueZ3b3uyyMzhJFHTA	1	2017-02-21	3	0

Thali with tiny cups and variety dishes is another favourite specially the vata kolambu. I love the cabbage curry too. samabr vada is another favourite. I was wondering about the tip money I left for the server. I did not see the server come back for it. but supervisor/manager lady took the money and went inside. I am wondering how much does the server get? I went twice after that day, but did not find the server who had served me. other restaursnts have a tip collection box and the money goes there. I was charged extra for a coffee I did not drink I brought it to their notice and it was taken off without an apology. well, I love the food, and I am willing to overlook these thing.D James, Etobicoke	TFDT0ueZ3b3uyyMzhJFHTA	4	2014-06-07	0	0

The food is much better now and we visit this place a couple of times a month and are pleasantly surprised with the changes. 2014 Review:I'm really disappointed with the degrading quality of food and service at this place. I'm not a fan of this place, but decided to give it another chance as my friend wanted to eat here.The place has been upgraded, which is about the only good thing with this restaurant. The new management is pathetic and the food equally worse. We went in on a Monday night for dinner and the waitress took our order and took close to half and hour to get our appetizer. The vada was spoilt and when we mentioned it to her, she just ran away and came back after a while to say that ""This is how it is"" !!! and she did not even apologize. How Rude!!!! She seemed to have a lengthy discussion in the Kitchen and another waitress came to our table and served our food almost 40 minutes later. She did however apologize for the delay. Much better than our previous waitress. We were appalled at the quality of service here and vowed never to come back here again and recommend people from going here ever.If you'd like to get good South Indian food in Mississauga, goto either Udupi Madras Cafe or Chutney Swamy or Guru Lakshmi."

Sambar that's key to a South Indian Dosa meal must always be served hot but was served cold. Their excuse for cold sambar was that they're just preparing it because of the rush. Shouldn't that mean the sambar should be hot?!?  And their servings for sambar are too small. They skimp on the chutneys. We'd ordered a Kara dosa which they got wrong. Not authentic at all. Hot coffee served cold. And when we asked for it to be brought back and served hot we got a lame excuse that the milk was just poured fresh, what fresh from the fridge?!?  When they did take the coffee back, it never was served again. And we still got billed for it. We asked for water several times.  Not served!!!  They finally brought out a jug of water as we were putting on our jackets to leave.  This is the 3rd time in as many months that I've made the mistake of coming here. But no more.  This place sadly does not have its act together and gets a big fat zero in both the food and service department. One of the staff even have the excuse that cold food is a 'kitchen problem'. Hello, is management listening.  With this sort of customer service I seriously wonder why the place is busy or popular. If I could I would give them negative marks. One things for sure., they've lost an avid foodie customer.	TFDT0ueZ3b3uyyMzhJFHTA	1	2014-03-22	0	0

Used to be an awesome South Indian buffet for breakfast with hot kaapi served with idli dosa and wada and a background music of suprabhatam to augment your weekend into a bliss... But off late the service is unbearable... I used to go as the food was atleast better than the others... Today the food also was a huge let down! Sambhar with no sambhar aroma just daal with tempering of curry leaves and mustard seeds and idli, dosa, wada all undercooked and stone like texture and not to mention cold ..... And a background music of titanic? Really? This has to be a management issue.. Even the rava upma was disastrous ... The table was not even served water! I would just like to add is this restaurant was special to me and I used to come here very often... This is a yelp alert to other people to avoid this place and not to get their heart broken like me! If you are still thinking to try this place let me tell you they don't have gulab jun the only star entry of this place and have some cheap kesari...

The supposedly spicy 'kara' dosa was tasteless and the potato stuffing inside was a violent red colour- using red food colour does not make anything spicy people!My friend ordered another dosa which was so greasy that it had no taste but stale oil.The thali looked OK but tasted zilch. The little bowls that the sambar came in...that was a mystery...some of them were stuck inside the other- probably the dishwasher could not get them separated- so basically that meant that the lower one was dirty. When we complained the server mumbled something and then never showed his face. Never going back here again	TFDT0ueZ3b3uyyMzhJFHTA	1	2012-02-09	3	0

I am not aware that this automatic gratuity mentioned in the menu card. Can someone advise  if this is legal?  Anyway I think it is a dishonest practice. I am really disappointed.

1	QgiR84sGGz1jpGLMs-ZGSA	Lc7GzIzD7n06dfyqvihKRg	So I'll start by saying I had a terrible experience at the flagship location in Chennai, India in 2005. Since then, I swore off coming to this place ever again (no matter what corner of the world). So after successfully boycotting this restaurant for 12 years, I was forced into going on a recent family dinner. Now I'll tell you why I will not go back again:1. They sat us directly next to the cash and a waiter just hovered outside of the register directly behind my seat. Table was not clean! 2. We were a party of 6 and received 3 menus. When I asked for an additional 3 menus, I was handed one without a word and the waiter walked away. Another one walked by and I asked for an additional two menus and was asked why I couldn't share and rolled her eyes?! (Ummm ok)3. Six people, 5 spoons. It was a mission to get another spoon. 4. One of our appetizers came after our mains because we asked if it was coming (I'm guessing they forgot to put in the order)? 5. Not enough napkins. We asked for more and got 2. (Maybe they're saving money by reducing napkin waste?!) 6. Had to ask four times for extra sambhar before getting any. Overall, the food was not anything special. There are many other dosa places that serve far better quality food and actually care about their customers. The service is horrendous. We went on a Monday evening around 6pm. They were not busy and many servers were just hanging around chatting with each other. When interacting with customers they behave in a manner that leads me to believe that the customer is a burden and they are not interested in ensuring a positive experience.Thank you for reminding me why I had not eaten here since 2005 and why I should never eat here again.

It never was my ""go to"" place for dosa, but after an extremely unhealthy-greasy feeling at Guru Lukshmi one time, Saravanaa became a recent first-pick. My dad and I decided to try the weekend vegetarian buffet. The restaurant gets super busy and for the South Indian food lover, this could be paradise. However, for a person like me who goes for selective items only (dosa, idli, chutney), this didn't exactly strike much of a chord in my heart. The dosa was subpar and I found the supply limited and fleeting. Every 20-25 minutes, the staff put out dosas that were gone in 5-10 minutes. Same story with idli. It was fantastic having all-you-can-eat coconut chutney though. A lot of places skimp out on that one in particular. Overall, an okay experience. I probably wouldn't return for a buffet. I'd like to select my kind of crisp dosa next time."	TFDT0ueZ3b3uyyMzhJFHTA	3	2016-01-26	4	0

So when looking for a dosa fix, and a proper one, I have tried to come here.I came here about 3 times this year.The service is minimal. You get your food, which comes in small portions, and you get out. You pay at the counter at the front. So that kind of tells you what type of set up this is.Zero ambiance. hard cold seats, storefront setting, in a plaza. Walls peeling. It is all veg food - no meat. The dosa was barely filled. I mean, barely. I would say two tablespoons of filling in the large paper dosa.I would rather go to Annjapar a bit further south.	TFDT0ueZ3b3uyyMzhJFHTA	1	2014-01-09	0	0

To be honest, it's not terrible like some of the reviews would have you believe. But it's not particularly amazing either. Maybe if we had ordered from the menu, it would have been better, but we opted for the buffet option, and it was all... one-note... Not bad. Just not mind-blowing. It was food stuffs that helped fill our bellies before we left town. It's closer to a [*][*] experience in that ""I've experienced better"" but a lot of the [*] reviews are unnecessarily harsh. I didn't touch the sambar. Sambar is one of those things that varies quite a bit even between two people from the same part of India. Personal experience has taught me that ingesting sambar (especially sambar that you've never had before) before a long road trip (or in my case, a long road trip and then a long plane trip) is asking for trouble and shaky leg syndrome."

Last time visited Delhi's Saravana Bhawan and it was really good. We can't even compare this Saravana to Delhi's Saravana. I didn't liked there sambar and dosa was not crispy at all even filter coffee was like Tim Hortons! Also the thali is limited... Can you imagine?!? For the first time I experienced this kind of thing... We just needed 1 extra poori and for that only we had to pay. We visited Bahrain's Saravana also... Even that branch is also far better than this one!	TFDT0ueZ3b3uyyMzhJFHTA	2	2016-06-25	0	0
0	39VYc2nWSdvdTCldsDJ7qw	OVZ-TCbfh7fSu0vKVLZRrw	I would like to update my review on this place based on my experiences since.I decided to try something different other than the usual thali. So I tried their Kara dosa, which came out to be a thick, soggy dosa with a sweet tomatoey sauce. Then when I visited again I decided to give their dosa's another shot and opted for their Mysore masala dosa, which I have loved in other restaurants. They warned me that this dosa is supposed to be spicy but I can handle heat so I was fine with that. But again, I ended up getting a overly thick dosa that was too soggy and tasteless. My brother got the chole bhatura, which he enjoyed but complained that the bhatura's were a bit too oily. So I feel that ordering something other than the dosa would be your best bet because their dosa's are just not worth it and you can get much better ones at Guru Lukshmi or Udupi.

""More sambar, More Chutney?"" Yes, please! After getting way more than 2 people could eat (come in groups) we packed it up and of course left with more sambar and more chutney.  Sat and Sun, the buffet offers all the south indian food you could eat, (AYCE) and desserts. Try just a bite of these super sugary, fried desserts and think about jogging back to downtown TO."

If you are a newbie to the cuisine go on Sunday for the buffet when you can try a bit of everything If you familiar with South Indian food, the mini Idlis, paper masala and the adai aviyal are something that you can always bet will be great.

0	B4Rwp0SUYwO8lgSHVT9w5g	OLSuyCoeOLaOgSfHeXsBcQ	I am a huge fan of Guru Lukshmi and they set a really high bar for dosa in GTA. Unfortunately, Saravanaa Bhavan was a big letdown. We went in pretty late on a sunday afternoon. The decor has been recently upgraded which gives the place a clean modern look although it is still based in a strip mall. Most tables around us were having the thali which should have given us some strong signals. We ordered the vada sambar but the quality of the sambar was not good. The vada was not crispy as well which let the whole dish down. The onion and chili utappam was the biggest disappointment. It was so thick and dry inside that after a few bites we just did not have the appetite to finish it. The chillies were huge and it was quite a task to remove them from the almost thick pizza crust like utappam. The saving grace was the onion rava dosa but they had stuffed pepper in it which was annoying since it was quite strong. The accompanying chutney portion is too small and they were not flavorful at all. I am never going back again! Go spend your money at Guru Lukshmi. I am surprised they are a global chain with such poor quality of south indian food.	TFDT0ueZ3b3uyyMzhJFHTA	1	2014-05-26	0	0

I have tried Saravanaa Bhavan in Dubai and this place comes nowhere close to it.I ordered dosa and madras coffee. The coffee came before the dosa. I requested the server to give the coffee a little later as it would get cold before the dosa would even arrive. But guess what, the server plainly refused. I didn't want to create a scene in front of my colleague. Finally the dosa arrived and guess what again, it had hair on it. Yes the dosa that I wanted my colleague who never tried south indian food in his life, was trying it for the first time and the dosa had HAIR on it !!!At this point I was going to almost lose it. But I kept my calm and requested it to be changed and hoped that there would be no cockroach.Totally ruined my experience and I'm sure my colleagues as well.

The only upgrade as of now is the restaurant itself. A few months ago it was very unattractive, almost cafeteria style, with hard seats like you would find in a food court. Kudos to them for getting a massive facelift. I wish I took pictures, but it looks lovely inside. They even have an electric fireplace (for some reason) in the tiny entrance. But ambiance aside, the food itself did not get a similar makeover. I will never again order a masala dosa from this place. There was a mere SMEAR of potato bhaji, a few tablespoons at most, in my dosa. The chutneys were pretty bland and also in small amounts. The best thing was the sambar, spicy and warming. The dosa itself was very oily.My dad had the Saravanaa Special Meal, which consisted of ten TINY dishes (curries, chutneys, curd and a gulab jamun), rice, two papad and two pooris. As is the apparent custom here, the poories were miniscule. They were baby poories. I mean, how much are they saving really by cutting the quantity of their menu items? And it's not like this place isn't hopping. We got there at 7pm for dinner and already a queue had formed. This was the trend for the rest of the night, and people even crowded outside and left when they were told it would be a half an hour wait.The waitstaff were pleasant enough, although our server tried to take away my plate before I had finished. They also left the front door open for a while, telling us ""the air conditioning was not working"". It is necessary to note that it was 10 degrees tonight, not a balmy summer at all. This restaurant is NOT good for groups. There are tables of 4, and they can put a few together if needed. But do not come in with a group of 15, like people did tonight, and assume you will get a table quickly. Check ahead of time if you can make reservations.My mom had the best meal tonight, the Mini Tiffin. It came with uppama, mini idlis in sambar, a mini dosa (with probably the same amount of bhaji as my dosa!) and a sweet. The sweet sheera was delicious, with cashews and raisins. Sad I didn't go for that.PROS:- nice ambiance, comfortable booths- delicious, spicy sambarCONS: - oily dosas with virtually no filling- crowded early, stays that way through dinner- NOT good for groups (call ahead)- hasty servers who do not consider the weather- miniature food"	TFDT0ueZ3b3uyyMzhJFHTA	2	2014-05-18	0	0

The Parotta was good but not excellent: a bit small and not quite the right flavour compared to other Parotta I have had. The Rasmalai dessert is fantastic - although the presentation is nothing like the menu picture (no saffron strands) and suffers as a result.  I will definitely come again if I am in the area. For those new to South Indian food, it would be a great introduction, but those who are picky may not like it as much.	TFDT0ueZ3b3uyyMzhJFHTA	4	2015-07-13	0	0
0	-9RU4LuI_TfYgv9rBijJoQ	tLQ-BpRYz1HvoHPWhSVlTQ	We usually go to Anjappar Chettinad one weekends when I have a strong craving for a South Indian breakfast. My review is going to be a mild comparison of the two. We decided to try Saravan Bhavan a few days ago as I like trying different options. The breakfast buffet on Sunday is from 10-12 and we had arrived at 11:10 to quite a line up. We were seated at 11:30. The first thing I noticed was that the dosas, idlis and vadas are much better than anjappar and are really well made. The sambhar and tomato chutney is delicious as well. One of the reasons I crave this breakfast is because I love Rava Kesari and Payasam. The rava kesari was quite tasteless and the payasam seemed to have been thickened with starch rather than reduced the way it should be. We asked for two coffees as we noticed that there were no beverages in the buffet area (In comparison, anjapar has coffee that you help yourself to) and they brought us two very small coffees that were quite good. We didn't know until it was time to pay the bill that each of the 150 ml coffees were $2.25 each adding $4.50 to the total. For two people with coffee the bill came to $29.90 plus tip. I have rated it two stars because of the overall experience - food, service and pricing. Final verdict: Liked- vadas, dosas, idly, sambhar and taste of the coffeeDisliked: Service, wait time, pricing, poor tasting deserts, overall experience. Won't return.

Come from Madras (the birth place of this chain) I would say it's the same flavour and taste as back home.  It doesn't mean that's it's a great place to eat out south Indian food around here.

The service is alright, not the fastest but reasonable . Everytime I've been here, I've noticed that the place is kinda crowded .. so there is a lot of noise but then if I choose to eat out then I should not complain about the noise I guess.Food is good if you are not looking for the typical spicy taste that Indian food is known for.

I'm a carnavore and make few eceptions about not having some meat on my plate, but I have to say I don't even miss it when I eat here. My wife and I have only ever gone for the buffet. I eat my vada with sambar,  my dosa with rice and tomato chutney, and my puri with potato or rice. It tastes amazing and I've never left without being so full that I'm uncomfortable, which is a good thing. The only reason I don't give them five stars is because they need to expand. It's always so busy that the service is close to chaos. But I'd much rather have great food and slow service than great service and terrible food. I recommend this place to any meat lover like myself to prove that the occasional meat free meal can be very enjoyable.	TFDT0ueZ3b3uyyMzhJFHTA	4	2015-08-02	0	0
6	Hg1EF9PjGfcKBSNMjvWBeQ	e3XMzPuzQa-okjIR4nGo7w	This was THE SHITTIEST first-dosa-tasting of my life. I know it's impossible to rate my first-tasting of anything, but I'm pretty sure when you get a sour stomach and horrible shits after being at a restaurant - it was a horrible first experience. I really hope dosas don't actually taste like what they did here. The food item itself can't be that horrible or else no one would eat it, right? But you see, I'm traumatized to a point where I might not even consider re-evaluating what they taste like and just leave it at that. The service was shoddy. The drink prices (non-alcoholic) are shitty for the amount you get, which is close to nothing. The venue looks like a McDonald's in an airport food court. If this is what they think south India should be, then I recommend that Britain reoccupy. The only thing I'd recommend is the Madras coffee, to-go. That's the one thing they didn't manage to screw up royally.And paying $30 for all this, that was the rotting cherry on top.	TFDT0ueZ3b3uyyMzhJFHTA	1	2010-07-13	4	0

I am not much of a vegetarian, but i would go here for Dosas as well as other tasty dishes. The service is good, not the best, but still good.The place is clean, and has the sink to wash your hands, without going to the washrooms...a must for your seasoned foodie.

0	kD9Gr2IxZQv0CNp5D-Bsjw	dsb7RjU_QuzAvKkemfMaVA	I love a good fixin' of dosa every now and then. When I do have it, I always go in with expectations (which I'm working on) of the dosa rice crepe itself having to be crispy, the potato filling has to be spicy and spread evenly inside the dosa crepe. Craving dosa, I went to Udupai first (one of my favorite dosa restaurants) but they were closed on a Tuesday for lunch! Hence, I ended up coming to Saravanaa Bhavan due to proximity & time crunch. I guess it was a good excuse to try it out. Here's what I found at Saravanna Bhavan: -Mom and I ordered 2 Spicy Kara Dosas. We found them to be rather soggy and oily -The potato filling was blood red in color, making me think they had added in a ton of food coloring -The dosa crepe was overly thick-Chutney's were okay; however they really skimped on it. I also found that the chutneys were rather inconveniently served to the left into three portions of the thali (steel square plate)-The sambar was okay; nothing special. For some odd reason unbeknownst to me, they had used 2 katoris (small steel bowls) which were stuck together to serve the sambar in -As for service, there was only one person serving when mom and I went here for lunch making service slow. Sure it was decently priced; but the quality of food and service was worth WAY LESS than the $8 we cashed out for each dosa. Unfortunately, food and price do not go hand-in-hand here.

It offers good south indian food without the bells and whistles like Chinese hakka Masala dosa or the likes!! The food is very true to its roots and the chutneys and curries are cooked in chennai - tamilian styles.  The place recently was revamped and is more organized and looks much neater. The servers are polite and the food is delivered without a very long wait time. I ordered the thali and it was very very delicious !	TFDT0ueZ3b3uyyMzhJFHTA	3	2014-06-24	0	0

It was all quite flavourful, though I found the soup to be a little too spicy. The mango lassi was quite nice and cooling after the soup. It was fairly busy on a Saturday night, but tables come available quickly and service is quick.  The furniture is a strange mix of marble style tables and old library chairs.  The floor was a little messy with bits of food, but otherwise the restaurant was clean. It's an interesting place; we'll be back to try some other options.	TFDT0ueZ3b3uyyMzhJFHTA	3	2016-01-17	0	0

I have been going to another very famous South Indian restaurant which has forgotten how to serve their guests lately and the staff seems to be very arrogant lately. Sarvana wasn't too busy at the moment of our visit on Sunday night at 9 and the food was delivered quickly. The dosas were delicious and crispy and sambhar was hot and just as i hoped. Staff has always been extremely polite at this place and i really enjoyed going back to a place that gets it right. Everybody in our group agreed that my favorite dish, paneer dosa, was the best they have ever tried. Will be going back there soon and telling all my friends about it too.

Per my mom, the portions were excellent, the sauces/dips tasted good and were plentiful, and the dosa itself was very good. I thought it tasted quite yummy but spicy (my mom says that's the point!), and was fairly filling. Around $8 for a masala dosa, which like I said is a good sized meal.Service was very prompt, and the lady serving us seemed pleasant. The restaurant was fairly full at lunchtime.

There was never once when I had received good service. The server working there seems like he hates his job. He's been working there for as long as I dined there.The dosa is average. However! The idly and poori always arrives at our table cold. The poori is so hard that it's barely edible. 50 % of the times, you will get good sambhar. But 50 % of the times you will get sambhar that is watered down and looks like water too.I really hope they improve their service and food. Don't serve the stale and hard poori to your customers!

Then when seated, again another 15 minute wait and I had to ask to be served. We had a pretty simple order-2 people, 4 items. They managed to mess it up. Food took forever to come and one item was missing. When I asked for the item the wait staff denied I had ordered it-their computer clearly confirmed otherwise. The manager came by and said 'sorry we can't handle the crowd.' Um...you're running a restaurant with a certain number of seats. What are you doing if you can't handle the customers? And to boot-they offered us a free dessert (which we didn't want) but didn't take a penny off the bill. The food was mediocre. Stay far far away from this place.

The only thing which threw away the stars was; while were eating the dosa, at the end we found a rubber band piece in the potato masala. I told the owner when I went to pay and he was very apologetic and stated we should have told him earlier and he would have made another one for us.	TFDT0ueZ3b3uyyMzhJFHTA	3	2016-10-09	1	0

Great service and fantastic food, however only gave 4 out of 5 stars for two reasons:  (1) waiter forgot to bring our lassi (yet it was charged on the bill and we had to ask for it to be removed.. oh well, not too big a deal, it was an accident), and (2) the timing of bringing our dishes.  We ordered one appetizer to share, and four entrees.  One entree came first, several minutes later the appetizer came, and then several minutes later second entree, and several several minutes later the third entree, then much later the last entree came.  It wasn't ideal for us to be eating one at a time, lol.  This is a great restaurant to try if those two things don't bug you :)	TFDT0ueZ3b3uyyMzhJFHTA	4	2013-06-02	0	0

This time I ordered the paper dosa, sweet lassi and the special madras coffee.  The dosa and lassi were great.  The coffee was awesome! I'm not a coffee drinker but I liked that fact that it wasn't strong (they can make it strong if you want it that way) and I asked for sugar on the side. It comes in a cute little stainless cup in a small bowl and it has a lot of froth on top.  All in all a tasty meal.  At the end (where the cashier sits) I had some of the saunf (fennel) with candy...its good for digestion and its nice to eat something sweet (and free) at the end of the meal.

It is pretty cheap for some good food.  Just ignore the pig hanging from the ceiling if you find that gross and also ignore the food rating as I survived my visit and I am sure you will yours.  Just make sure to wipe down your silverware when you get them.Personally I really liked the BBQ pork which you can see hanging with all the meat in little strips; which, they cut up and serve with rice is really good.

I would expect more from a dealership that represents such a great brand. Paid just over $1000 for my yearly service. They called me to ask if I could come back to collect some touch up pens. I refused to battle traffic so they sent it with their shuttle driver. My accountant needed the invoice for the original purchase of the car. Spoke with Chloe on a Monday who said she would send it via email. Waited one day-no invoice. After 4 phone calls with multiple messages,  I had to be insistent that something so simple be escalated to the attention of the manager. If they can't handle something so simple, I don't know how they handle the intricacies of fixing European car. Worries me a bit. I was also told that they would have to go onto their stock room to find invoice. That could've been communicated in a professional way well before the fourth phone call. Not respectful that people are busy. I would avoid and go to another dealership.	2UmvDC88Wj3eKOBLFTh86w	1	2017-06-09	0	0

I called and was told the battery for the key would need to be recharged a ten minute job I was told. As I drove in there were two service reps and 5 clients all waiting in line. So the ten minutes came and went and eventually the assistant manager asked me what the problem was I explained he checked the key and said they needed to order a part but the car was safe to drive.Half an hour later my husband gets a call to say the part is in and they can fix the problem tomorrow. He calls back three times to eventually get someone live who insists there is no record of me going to the garage or of anyone calling my husband so ""We must be mistaken""!!!Finally I have had it call back and ask for the service dept someone live and no v/mail - the girl on reception asks me over and over is it for an appointment or do they have my car in already. I reply neither - she asks the questions again this time no so politely I tell her to just put me through she then cuts me off.So I call back and thank goodness get ""Sarah"" who I always dealt with until her mat leave. I tell her the problem she is gone for two seconds and comes back to tell me the car needs to be with them tomorrow as they have the part. So my recommendation is do not deal with any of the brainless reps there - deal with Sarah she is polite -super efficent and gets results...........................Still battling over wether we will get a courtesy car which is part of our lease agreement with Audi but they always seem to fail at!!"	2UmvDC88Wj3eKOBLFTh86w	1	2012-06-28	2	0

After that, every time I came in for service was a nightmare. I made an appointment for service just this afternoon, and I came in at 2 pm, then I've been waiting for more than 2 hours for the service to be completed! I was told that they would arrange a shuttle service to get me home, and I've been sitting in the lobby waiting forever ! Then the last time I checked with them, they told me that where I live, which is Bloor and Dufferin, which is practically still downtown, is too far, so they can't drive me home,but they can drop me off at a subway station. Then the guy promised me to drop me off at Young and Bloor, and told me their driver was outside and would be back in 5 mins, then I continued to wait, for another 45 mins until my car's ready, and I drove home. I am extremely unsatisfied with the service, because of that, I need to re-arrange my plans for the afternoon. The guy at the desk was like "" It's been crazy today. There's nothing we can do"". If you are considering getting an Audi, I strongly recommend you getting your car at other dealers. The service here was unacceptable. I also came in once because I noticed the drive's side mirror didn't change angles when I back up, and it supposed to. I had to explain it over and over again, but they failed to fix it for the first 2 times. Overall, I am so disappointed with the service, now that my warranty is expired, I don't think I'll ever come back."	2UmvDC88Wj3eKOBLFTh86w	1	2014-08-29	6	0

Because they couldn't repair a tailight bulb last week, I had to return today to repair the matter. There were 2 customers ahead of me when I arrived at the appointed 9:30am, the same service personnel was handling matters. Get this: it took 35 minutes for the guy to serve these 2 customers and he wasn't even done (he was supposed to simply take their keys, note the issues, print an order sheet). He was wasting time chatting with one customer about the pros and cons of PC Windows when there are customers waiting. He didn't even acknowledge my existence or simply inform me to wait. Giving up, I placed my car keys on his desk and spoke with WIlliam Yip, the manager, who said he would handle it.The facilities are nice but extremely short staffed and the guys at service do not know how to prioritise or customer service!	2UmvDC88Wj3eKOBLFTh86w	1	2009-05-09	4	1

What a great atmosphere at the dealership, no pressure from Keif or Alexandra in finance and everyone else was very friendly also. Buying a car can be very intimidating and they took all that away. Robin the sales manager also helped make my decision easy. Would recommend them to anyone looking for a new or used Audi. Thank you.	2UmvDC88Wj3eKOBLFTh86w	5	2016-09-26	0	0

But when you're bringing your car in for maintenance or repairs, you won't get the same kind of service. Things rarely get fixed and you will be told everything is working as intended if you complain about abnormal behaviours. I once took my car in for alignment, and the car still didn't drive straight! Then I was told it's due to angle of the pavement. I can't wait to get ouf the lease and dump this dealer for good! I love audis, but I will take my business to Markham dealer.	2UmvDC88Wj3eKOBLFTh86w	2	2012-11-27	1	0

Their service advisors are defensive, they avoid necessary repairs and don't listen to or follow-up on problems. I had so many issues I had to contact Audi Canada to get them to intervene. Finally I got the needed repair but when I went in for it I was faced with the same problems, lack of advisors so it delayed the process of registering the vehicle for service, and there was no apology for all of the delays.This deanship continues to do damage to the Audi brand. I wonder if Audi Canada will ever step in.	2UmvDC88Wj3eKOBLFTh86w	1	2014-08-29	4	0

Great selection of craft beers, my first brew was The Nines.  Great Red Ale, very smooth even though it's IBU was 90.  My wife had the Coffee Brown Nitro which was awesome.

0	1jwFGYysI1ZTGyWp0M_dwg	Okv5rF8EN0HlB9-bCHyRfQ	"First and foremost, I seriously love this place! First look:  The whole place has a very cool, very inviting vibe.  The decor (industrial, rustic wood mixed with some seriously cool and unique art) hangout areas (sweet beer garden), lighting that makes everyone look pretty/handsome (with or without beer goggles) and a window looking into the brewery operation.  These features make it a really special place.  Even the restrooms are rad. It looks like a lot of love went into every detail.The Beer:This is a true tasting room.  I equate it to going to your favorite wine tasting room and enjoying the various types of wine, except it's delicious beer (obviously). (e.g.; the Nines, you gotta try the Nines!). What it is not is a pub or a sports bar with super loud people, Budweiser and NFL whistles blowing from 50 TV screens...which is refreshing.  I feel a person just starting to develop their beer palette would feel right at home bellying up to the bar along side a person with a honed, mature beer palette. It's a place to try and sample what suits your beerbuds best.  With tons of amazing beer options that have awesome names you know have a story behind them, you can't go wrong.  My husband tried the coffee brown ale and he loved it! Oh, and it looks like they offer special ""reserve"" and yummy flavored type brews each week as well.  Best to check out their Insta and Facebook pages for weekly beer offering updates.The staff:Great staff,  knowledgeable, welcoming, efficient and accommodating.  Eager to make you feel right at home.The food:I've eaten many burgers in my life, let me tell you.  Had the most delicious. burger. ever from the onsite food truck.  I think they are called, Fire and Forged.  Like the Shop, the food truck folks took great care to give me their best.  Quality beef cooked to medium rare perfection. Homemade pickles (homemade pickles people! Who does that!?!).  Real/non-iceberg lettuce.  Some seriously special sauce, too.  Paired wonderfully with the Nines! (See what I did there? )Overall:Great night out with the Mr. Even bought a couple super softy shirts and of course bought a few cans of the Nines to take home to CA.  Do yourself (and your mouth) a favor and get over to the Shop.  They are doing some seriously good work there.  Wish we had one back home..."	e-hztV3mlfn5z8VmRFBNlw	5	2016-10-18	3	1

Like how the beertender was mellow despite some Tempe bartender douchebag telling him he needed to speak louder and with more authority.  The pale ale is surprisingly more hopped and higher IBU than the IPA.  I enjoyed IT.

The staff is extremely knowledgeable/helpful and it shows in the beers they produce. They have a food truck in their patio area that has a constant presence; the chef consistently rotates the menu with all kinds of goodness that pairs fantastic with the brew. Must try beers when you go are Church Music & F.Y.I.T.M. ..... However, you can't go wrong in any selection you make. Might as well take a flight or two and experience for yourself.

0	7fHmEe2V87xvN6MAEhFHJA	hid1uBDuwYu4KY_qOWfVVA	The Shop Beer Co is located in N Tempe not too far from ASU ...It's a smaller cozy cool independently owned microbrewery that I didn't know ever existed.  One of the girls in the group had purchased a beer tasting deal off of Groupon and it was as an amazing price/deal!!! The amount of beer that comes with this deal is ridiculous - no joke!!It's a nice looking establishment - very cool inside look... There is also a large back patio, a food truck, and then the bathrooms are located near the actual brewery area in a separate building. I am not a huge fan of alcohol, beer in particular, but I was open to tasting specialty micro brewed beers.  Some of the beers were awesome, some okay, some were hard to drink.  A place like this is for a true beer conoausor because they do offer a fair amount of diverse beers, but I don't know enough about beer, how it's made, ingredients, etc. to be overly critical about beer quality per say.  I would have to say that the darker beers here seemed smoother than the light/amber, and the beer made by/using coffee were the best tasting in my personal opinion.When we first arrived the place was slammed - we could hardly find a place to sit down.  But oddly enough, the crowd died down very fast and by the time we finished our tasting around 7:30ish there was hardly anyone left in the place - it was dead for the most part, which seemed rather odd on a Friday evening.  The staff here was good - but no one was especially friendly or went out of there way service wise even when it got super slow....The crowd seemed like college kids for the most part ... So it wasn't really our scene and I doubt I would go out of my way to come back here ... There is just too many other great spots to hang out in Tempe & Scottsdale.This place earns a solid 3 start review because it was good/average ... overall there was nothing very good/exceptional or memorable about my experience here other than the fact that they offered a phenomenal groupon deal.  It's definitely worth checking out though, and I would recommend beer lovers to definitely come try it out!  If you are not a huge fan of alcohol or you don't like beer ... This is not the place for you because to my knowledge for the most part they only serve beer and water.	e-hztV3mlfn5z8VmRFBNlw	3	2017-06-18	0	1
0	uE590yKd81Dye9XgKFK7MQ	Zug--S8mlTW92CNT91gkpw	Awesome Brewery! I stumbled across this place on it's opening day, at least the opening to the public, and even that's kind of an opening. Today was friends and family day, and special invited people, but if the public showed up but let them in and give them a free beer!So, I showed up!... and who did I get to meet but Harry Mitchell, Kelli Butler, Dr. Eric Meyer, and a whole bunch of people who really love brewing craft beer. It was a great crowd, and excellent beer.There were two food trucks, one served poutine made Southwestern style, and instead of french fries, they sliced up tamales, and served the gravy and chilies on the top of that! By the way, that food truck was run by a guy named Craig.I had tried three of their beers the pale ale the IPA and the red and they were all excellent beers. I been to them before when they were cartel brewing and they were over in the old apartment building, and when they were in the coffee shop, but this venue is really nice and the the energy is palpable!I definitely will come back here, even when there are no political celebrities!	e-hztV3mlfn5z8VmRFBNlw	5	2016-08-27	0	0

They have about six beers that they brew and another six to eight beers that they bring in. There's a food truck parked on site, I ordered the street tacos. I love the inside as much as the outside. There are plenty of tables, high tops, low tops and  bar seating.  This place has a cool vibe. Staff is friendly. They were more than happy to give samples of their brews with no charge.

Two employees were inside, one of whom was talking/flirting with a patron at the only occupied table inside (one other table was occupied outside). Neither employee in any way acknowledged either of us. We reviewed the beer leaf for a minute or two, still with no acknowledgement from any of the staff, no hello, no invitation to find a seat etc. felt extremely pretentious, and not our scene.

My boyfriend and I had gone hunting and showed up to this bar in our camouflage. You would have thought we were aliens by the way people looked at us. We just wanted to try some good beer via a Groupon I found. Service was okay but the overall atmosphere was unwelcoming. The beer was good. I enjoyed the Coffee Nitro. My boyfriend liked the IPA but thought it was a little weak for a double. Flavors were good overall. When we left I expected some sort of conversation and I would have left a tip. Instead we were told to redeem the Groupon on our own and that was it. Customer service is a must!

I have been a few times and the first time I thought it was difficult to find coming from Mill and around the train tracks. This time I came right off Rio Salado and it was right there. Much easier coming from that side. They have a great selection of beers, and always something new. The DIPA is a staple and one of the best in town. I had a couple of new IPAs this time (Church Music and Circus Bandit). Both were great. They also have crowlers available in the cooler. They do not have a food kitchen, but there is a food truck that stays there and serves excellent food. The inside bar is very nice with a lot of space, but for me the real highlight (at least for most of the year) is the patio. It is very large, has some trees, a portion of it is under a roof and makes for a great time. This past visit it was a perfect afternoon with good weather, a nice breeze, good music, and awesome beer. I could chill out there all evening.Definitely one of my favorite breweries in Phoenix and it's run by great people. I will always support them and their beers.	e-hztV3mlfn5z8VmRFBNlw	5	2017-04-01	3	1

I tried the Hoppy Red, the Sunset Daydream IPA and the Coffee Brown on nitro.  All three of them were pretty good.  The also have a nice food truck in the parking lot.  You order the food at the truck and then they find you and deliver it to where you're sitting inside.The servers were all friendly and very knowledgeable about craft beer.	e-hztV3mlfn5z8VmRFBNlw	4	2016-09-11	5	3

I usually come here on Wednesday's for their Randall (they infuse one of their beers with some other yummy ingredients)--I just recently had their pale ale with persimmons, dates and currants and it was so tasty! The food truck out back (Fire & Forged) cooks up some amazing, fresh food and switches up their menu frequently. The back patio is beautiful and dog-friendly.

I wish you all the best and thanks for making my business a success with the local crafted beer from your brewery. I carry four of the six beers you craft and my customers up here love them.

0	ktm2YMsb65tRnePcYpVlqg	DQB9JeyD4gRt_cnNWDBUug	Hooray for The Shop Beer Co! They really have the small-neighborhood-brewery thing down pat. I had the pleasure of chatting with one of the brewers, Andy, at the Strong Beer Festival while sampling their limited edition releases specifically for said event. The beers I tried there were AMAZING! One was the FYITM another was a special FYITM [i think a fruity version], and something else I can't recall. A week or so after, I host a Sunday Funday at The Shop for a large group of friends and luckily remembered to tell Andy about it at the Festival. He and his team were gracious enough to reserve space for our group. The weather didn't want to cooperate that Sunday but when I arrived it was fairly dead inside so I pushed together large floor tables in the corner with no problems. Andy did such a great job going over the beer list many times as people came in at varied times as well as keeping track of what we ordered and making sure the glasses did not run dry. I definitely recommend doing the flight - it's $8 for 4 samples which can be a mix from The Shop and/or some from their guest beers. If I have to pick just 2 beers from The Shop to drink, #1 is the Galactic Porter Patrol nitro, #2 is Circus Bandit. I also recommend their food truck outside. While the guy/waiter wasn't the kindest, the food was fabulous. I really loved the chicken tacos I had. Other positives I noted were the hummus dip and burger. I believe the food menu changes often [don't quote me]. Their ordering system is kind of confusing because you have to order beer & food separately but they come out on one check. How they keep that organized, I would like to know.	e-hztV3mlfn5z8VmRFBNlw	5	2017-03-14	3	0

Bingo Bango Bongo is beyond superb, as is Church Music and of course the ol' standard, F.Y.I.T.M.2. The music. Seriously, do you guys have a Pandora station? Whoever set that up has excellent taste and the music matches the atmosphere really well.3. The service, both inside and at their partner food truck outside.

I stumbled upon The Shop's tent in the first hour and I didn't leave.  I kept going back because they were pouring this delicious IPA that I couldn't get enough of, I didn't care what anyone else was pouring - it was that good.  When I got back to Phoenix I couldn't find the brewery anywhere.  No one had heard of The Shop, it was like I made it all up in my drunken stupor.  Finally someone did mention the name and I got the scoop that they wouldn't be opening for until August.  I started counting down the days till opening so I could get a taste of summa that epic beer, today was that day!My favorite brew is a double IPA is called FYITM.  Someone told me it stands for Fuck You In The Mouth and I don't know if that's true or not but I do know that my taste buds get an orgasm every time the beer enters my mouth so I think it's a solid name.	e-hztV3mlfn5z8VmRFBNlw	5	2016-08-27	3	4
0	DZOA0yCbH4kDS0s-dHXWFg	sVAmrMyXVK02SIPsPdil1g	"This is an awesome neighborhood brewery. It looks like someone's house with a food truck parked outside of it; apparently it was Mayor Mitchell's dad's home? Anyway, they have their own selection of brews as well as some guest beers. So far my favorites have been the Coffee Brown Nitro and the Circus Bandit. Many of their beers are a bit too hoppy for my taste, but their porters have been great. Their guest beer selections are usually pretty solid picks as well. Every Wednesday they do a special brew called ""The Randall"" that they infuse with their flavors of the week. Recently it was thin mints, once it was jalapenos and sometimes they serve it with an accompanying bite (once it was a donut). Follow them on Instagram for Randall announcements as well as updates about entertainment, sometimes they host bands on the patio.They do have a food truck, Fire and Foraged, which is basically a permanent on-site fixture. They are super creative with their food and have one of the best burgers I've ever had. They source a lot of their food locally-greens from Rhiba Farms and meat from Doublecheck Ranch-and as much as I hate not being able to rely on my favorites, I like that I'm hardly eve disappointed when I try something new. I recently had a salad here with hummus on it and who knew that salad needed hummus?! The space is cool-lots of patio seating, about 12 seats a the bar indoors and eight 4-tops. This could be a great option to buyout for a birthday party or small wedding reception to be honest; it has nice ambiance!This is a nice reliable place, walking distance from my house that I can just have a beer, a snack and leave pretty happy about all of it."	e-hztV3mlfn5z8VmRFBNlw	4	2017-03-10	3	1

Beers I sampled: The nines red: smokey but balanced all the way through. Bingo bango boingo: top ten IPAs I've had in my life. Super hoppy without the bitter taste. Would love an IV drip of this...Desert pale: usually I cling to pales but this one was overshadowed by how amazing everything else wasBut wait there's more! Then we start talking to the owner of the food truck planted outside, Craig. Solid guy. Lots of experience in the Fox concepts and Vegas restaurants and we got to chat him up about his experience. Really great guy. We ended up getting the meat and cheese board and he knew everything  about where the meats were from, where the veggies came from, how they were pickled and everything. Can't speak highly enough of Craig or this place.	e-hztV3mlfn5z8VmRFBNlw	5	2017-06-18	1	1

My friend that goes to ASU told us about it so we decided to make the drive from Gilbert and check it out. We purchased the groupon and each got a flight, a pint, and two crowlers. It really was a great deal however, they were out of a couple of the beers we wanted to try and the food truck is... meh. Pretty pricey for what you get and our chicken and fish tacos were a little dry. The chips and dip were delicious. Homemade chips with almost like a French dip. The environment is intimate and friendly and it's not usually busy. Not sure if we'd check it out again since we tried the beers we wanted to and weren't completely sold on any.

0	fFFpBkLzwg9evGEIVigpxg	wITc4a6oS13rMBUURi3usQ	The beer is pretty good and the food truck there is always great.  I am giving this review because they are obviously short pouring their customers.  You will note their glasses are exactly 16 ounces if they are pouring over.  They do offer some beers at a 13 oz pour but even when you get the 9 oz, 13 oz, 16 oz pours you will often get short pours for every single one of them.  I have been there over a dozen times now and easily over half of my drinks have been this way.  After a dozen visits I would say service is 60% good, 20% meh, and 20% bad.  I know it may seem minuscule to some but when you are buying premium product there should be pride in the company to give the customer what they are offering. Although they have good beer being ripped off leaves a bad taste in mouth and there are plenty of other breweries that offer just as good of beers if not better and do not rip their customers off.	e-hztV3mlfn5z8VmRFBNlw	2	2017-03-10	1	1

The sweet potato fries are fantastic and the dipping sauce just adds fuel to my firey addiction to sriracha. For vegetarians, I recommend the house salad (kumquats!), kimchi tofu, mushrooms, curry veggie and rice bowl and wash it all down with the gin rickey.	AfoBKJuGBJvQhc3By4K9Dg	4	2009-08-11	1	0
0	itmb9uAolzQnmEBDlV24qQ	1ypC-siSWIKS0XcGv8s34Q	I'm a little wary of Asian fusion restaurants, and I wasn't sure quite what to expect from Muramoto, but my dining partners (a chef and a personal chef) and I were thoroughly pleased with our light dinner on Saturday evening. We had two rolls, one eel and avocado and another tuna, avocado and some other stuff - both were fantastic. After seeing someone else with it, we also ordered the calamari with slaw and chili paste and, by far the best dish of the evening, the black miso seared cod. I've been remembering that cod all weekend, it was so good. There were a lot of other things on the menu that I wanted to try as well. Maybe another time.Actually, everything was really, really good. This was a place I would want to revisit if I lived in Madison. Although we didn't order anything off it, they did have a specials menu with at least three items, and the very extensive sake menu. Contrary to what one of the other reviewers said, I think it would be really hard for the average person to spend $100 alone unless you just stuffed yourself silly. We ordered five dishes total and two small bottles of sparking sake to share among three women and the bill was $85. Actually I couldn't quite believe how reasonable the bill was when it came. BTW, make reservations. We weren't in a hurry, so we went and had a drink and came back, but the dining area is quite small, so if you have more than two people you'll definitely want to call ahead on a weekend evening.

Their collection is enormous and I believed the owner claimed Muramoto has the best collection in midwest. If you are a sake lover and haven't been there, what  are you waiting for? and if you don't usually drink sake, you should still try the sake out (especially the ones list under fragrant) and you might change your view about sake forever.For the food Muramoto is Asian fusion in tapas style. Although each plate might be only around $10, most of them are not filling (rolls are the exceptions) and at the end combining your sake bill the check might cost as much as $100 per person.

IMO, the former more than makes up for the latter, which is at its worst just a bit slow and unconcerned.  (Once, for example, we were two dishes into our meal before our first round of drinks arrived.)But, ahh, the food.  This is probably the most creative food in Madison.  I describe it as pan-asian fusion in a tapas form factor.  There is some sushi, and some is even pretty good (I'm thinking of the signature duck mango avocado rolls).  That said, it's a mistake to think of Muramoto as a sushi place, though (there is a Muramoto sushi restaurant in the hilldale area ) -- my favorite dishes here have included the soy cod, a lamb curry, and a few amazing salads.  In my experience, the oft-changing menu contains little that isn't great -- an omnivore with an open-minded palate could safely close their eyes and just start pointing.Come with an appetite and prepare to spend a bit of change (dinner for 2 with drinks and dessert will exceed $100), and avoid the tables in the front near the door on cold days.

I adore places that encourage tapas style/family dining and Muramoto's portions are what some may describe as small.  (Two to share two entrees is just enough food.) Additionally I appreciate that food is brought out as it is done being prepared and does not suffer death under a heat lamp.For drinks I had Lychee Liquor and grapefruit juice which was mango-ey and so tasty. I'd consider coming back just for that concoction alone.  We ordered the Tuna with Wasabi Flying Roe, Shrimp in Spicy Coconut Sauce, and the Pan Seared Scallop. (which was the favorite dish)  All of our food embodied unique flavors, and were demonstrations of  ""Asian fusion"" done right.  Our server was incredibly helpful with questions, and prompt without seeming as if she was trying to rush us out the door.  Also prices were not that bad.  For 2 entrees, 1 roll, and drinks we exited the restaurant only about $60-ish poorer (including tip). I am definitely returning. I wish the restaurant was bigger and took reservations because I'd rent out the whole place for graduation."	AfoBKJuGBJvQhc3By4K9Dg	5	2008-06-10	1	0

They have some food, but it's not the same as the full restaurant.  However, their shochu drinks are more extensive at this location, so I had a shochu shiso mojito.  It was okay--not my favorite, but not bad either.  Maybe I should have tried a drink that wasn't trying to be another drink.  Anyway, the place is really nice, the bartenders are really nice.  Well worth a visit.	AfoBKJuGBJvQhc3By4K9Dg	4	2009-06-15	0	0

My recommendation is that this is the place to go with friends so that you can share dishes and try more stuff. Food quality is top notch and each dish really offers you a new experience. Only gripe about the place is that portions are SMALL and it's relatively pricey. expect to spend 20 plus per pax. A must try is their dessert sampler! Definitely going back : )	AfoBKJuGBJvQhc3By4K9Dg	4	2006-11-06	0	0

The chef's tasting is key. And use the bathroom with the sink that makes you want to get out your GI Joes and Barbies and play in the bubbles all night.	AfoBKJuGBJvQhc3By4K9Dg	5	2005-09-19	0	0
0	JWgti_adPZywG9SKUbnB-w	HyVFtiiJqbPKNQZ1QmZRBA	"Please note: Pricey, gourmet Restaurant Muramoto has moved down the street, and Kushi Muramoto has become a sort of ""Izakaya"" style place. Think Japanese Tapas. Reviews prior to November at this location should be thought as applying to it's new location, just down the street. I was not impressed by the food at Kushi. Your order will come out quickly, because almost everything is fried, fried, fried. The exception is the Donburi -- something yummy on rice. Our Eel Donburi was solid, and decently priced for $8... but if you're a Midwesterner with a healthy appetite like me, don't think this will make a meal. I also have a complaint about the drinks. My Cosmo was delicious -- and also standard Cosmo size and price ($7). However, because they make all their mixed drinks here with sake instead of vodka, what you're getting really packs much less of a punch than what you'd get elsewhere.The pluses are this: The atmosphere hasn't change since this was the pricey Muramoto, So it's a groovy low-lighting place to hang. Also, it's really reasonably priced. $4 drafts. $1.50-$2 things on a stick, $5.50-$8 for Donburi. So you can go out and feel like you're getting the ""Muramoto Experience"" without bleeding yourself dry.However, when they said ""fried Snickers are our only dessert and they're only 2 for a dollar,"" I was so sick of panko fried tidbits, I said ""no"" without a moment or regret."

It was heinous how sloppy our rolls came out, my date's food came out a full 20 minutes after my own, and the black cod was incredibly salty.  The place looked ""hip"" but that's about as cool as it got.   If you are looking to make a fashion statement then by all means dress yourself up and head to Muramoto, if you are looking to enjoy your meal (be it tapas, sushi, real japanese or some fusion) look elsewhere."

3	IHFVljMsPhMc2-lW3UMNuw	Toh-YLCULBVXyWsgn1_pPg	This place accommodated our party of 8 well-sauced gentlemen nicely. Our waitress was friendly and extremely helpful with our menu choices. Her recommendation of one roll and another fairly small plate was the perfect amount of food for us, as we had more beers to consume apres-dinner. I got the impression this is one of the nicer restaurants in Madison, because everyone was dressed up. Except us of course. In Chicago this would be a nicer-than-average sushi restaurant, but it's not on par with Japonais. Think more along the lines of Sushi Ra if the food at Sushi Ra were a lot better. Sort of a modern, almost trendy thing going on, with a pronounced wet bar. The food was good, but to be perfectly honest, I have no business reviewing a sushi restaurant since I usually don't get any of the real shit. If it's crispy and fried or if the flavor of the fish is masked by jalepeno, avocado, or cream cheese, that's just fine with me. So yeah, sorry I made you read this review for nothing.

Their other spot cross town is an incredible sushi restaurant with everything under the sun. Here, only have a few rolls on the menu (and they are incredible), but that is not why you come. Come for the tasty, hot dishes, and for the sake flights.Every so often, you eat a meal that is soooo good, so perfect in almost every way, and the tastes are so unforgettable, that you want to get right up then and there, and do what I affectionately call, The Food Dance. This is food that makes your eyes roll back into your head with every bite, and leaves you wondering where the hell you have been eating all these years. This was, hands down, my saving grace in Madison. Presentation of the food is spectacular. Eating alone? Sit at the bar and stare at um-teen bottles of Japanese sake. Eating with a group? Even better, as the sushi rolls they do have there (soft-shell crab or avocado and mango roll w/ thin-sliced duck breast on top, drizzled with a duck reduction sauce, or a few others) are HUGE. Don't think California sushi, as each roll which costs $10 has about ten large slices, and you will find it hard to eat an entire one by yourself. These rolls would easily be double the price if this was in SF.  Look for Michael, the tall, bald-shaven, server/barman that knows everything about the menu, and can recommend many good sakes on the list. Try the sake flight (3 glasses) for a nice accompaniment to any meal. Now for the best part........you want small slices of some of the tastiest beef anywhere? Get the hangar steak. Not a large portion (meaning not a whole steak) but you get several slices of this beef, drizzled with a white miso-bleu cheese sauce that is to DIE FOR. Not a fan of bleu cheese? No worries, as the taste is made subtle by the combining with miso. But please, do yourself a favor - ORDER THIS DISH! Not a big beef fan? That's fine, as the Grilled Miso Black Cod is their signature dish. My suggestion? Start with some sake, and order yourself one sushi roll, and one hot dish. Take a few people, and everyone order a few different things, and share. And won't you be happy when you get out of there, after all this tasty food, and still you are not over the per diem. And if you are, maybe you shouldn't have had that third drink. Be advised - this place has a little wooden sign in the window, and it took me forever to find it. Do me one better, and take the address WITH YOU when you go!	AfoBKJuGBJvQhc3By4K9Dg	5	2007-09-22	0	0

A varied menu with some fantastic Asian-inspired cuisine, this ain't your grandmother's Friday night fish fry.Update:  swing by on Sunday night to try the blind chef's tasting.  4 courses ending in dessert for $30.  Never disappointing.	AfoBKJuGBJvQhc3By4K9Dg	5	2005-05-03	1	0

Got to say, they're still serving the best ""imitation"" of the real stuff - doesn't really fly by me. But if you like that kind of thing, I suppose it's ok. Depending on the bartenders, some drinks are so underwhelming that it made me feel unnecessarily girly.  Oh well. On the positive note, I think it is fun to try out many small plates. So 3 stars for the fun factors. The hype doesn't match the food, though."	AfoBKJuGBJvQhc3By4K9Dg	3	2009-05-13	1	0
0	esaDbON8NXJC4PWt_CheUg	N6uMLOhrhQUmkwU9Iv97NQ	I am infatuated with my new love, Muramoto. At first, I was highly doubtful the state of Wisconsin could feature decent sushi but boy oh boy was I wrong. Mad props incredibly for the fact that they feature a deeeelicious Philly role with salmon and cream cheese. Heavenly! I enjoy the fact that they serve their edamame with big grains of salt to give it an extra kick. And last but certainly not least, I could drink a million of the Russian teas (a smooth mixture of kahlua and green tea vodka, which I have never tried or seen before this restaurant introduced me to it!) I end my Valentine to Muramoto with a shout out to its modern decor that made me feel like I was in big city again, and that it smells like fresh sushi on the inside, since most Japanese restaurants don't smell like anything! This is the first place of many in Madison that I have graced with 5 stars because I was that impressed!	AfoBKJuGBJvQhc3By4K9Dg	5	2007-09-09	1	0
0	MPozTU7MRVKYISO5prvzdg	XRzpHvkivRV9yHdjiNJ8ng	There were only a handful of rolls available at $10 each that are very fulfilling.  I would recommend the soft shell crab roll.  For some reason the Duck, Mango and Avocado roll made my stomach really queasy.  I didn't try the sake because it was a Monday night, but I would come back for the oyster shot!  A mixture of oyster, raw quail egg and spices it was something very unique!  I had two before my meal.  Slurrrrrp!	AfoBKJuGBJvQhc3By4K9Dg	4	2006-12-12	0	0
0	q91tQNboB-0HWtM8cXRjdg	WRvtog3sUIYxcYdJO-srYw	Yep, I did it- 5 stars.After a few missed attempts at going to muramoto, we finally made it in.We tried some sake to start it off, and the Wakatake was superb- at the suggestion of the waiter. Next were the oyster/quail egg shots. What a nice melding of flavors. This was followed by the corn/lemongrass chowder- big disappointment, but I'll let it slide.On to the main courses- started with the tuna/mayo roll. This was a quite a big portion and really was a great sushi roll for those that like the bells and whistles. The hangar steak was tasty. The bleu cheese sauce was just perfect and made the steak that much better. Could have used just a tad more crust on the meat. Finally, we had the miso black cod. This is how fish should taste. It melted in your mouth, and was salty, but in a great way. TIP- go early or late (after 9) because they don't take reservations.	AfoBKJuGBJvQhc3By4K9Dg	5	2008-04-13	0	0

The service is always great, not just that they are prompt and attentive, but they know the menu and the drink menu and can make intelligent recommendations that I am usually pleased with.  Muramoto's creative rolls are SO delicious, they are all different tasting and the only comparison to their taste comes from good sushi places in Chicago.  I get take out here at least once a week and dine here about once or twice a month.  If you want fantastic sushi at really a quite reasonable price, this is your place!

0	66e_wFUf4GsDT2DTZ3u-Xg	NDJPlFn9agAkfyo7mMB4Vw	Just to be clear, this is a review of the new 'tapas-style' Muramoto.  Ok, with that out of the way....The Space:  Just like the old Muramoto that was there, its a great space and feels like a 'big city' restaurant.  Dark, calm, cool, and the lighting is superb.  Great date place and it just feels sexy.The Food:  I wanted to like it, I really did.  We ordered a wide variety of small plates and not ONE of them was good.  In fact, even they even managed to blow bacon-wrapped figs stuffed with blue cheese.  Now thats not easy to screw up.  The plates ranged from merely ok to bad (octopus 'balls' were like fried croquettes with elastic bands in the middle).  The Drinks:  Drinks were good.  Good pours, good selection and the Japanese booze was interesting.  The Price:  Here's why Kushi Bar received an extra star.  The place is cheap for what it is, especially the drinks.So all in all, go for drinks, ambiance and to impress a date.  Maybe even order a small plate or two but don't expect it to taste as gourmet as it sounds on the menu...	AfoBKJuGBJvQhc3By4K9Dg	2	2009-06-03	1	0

0	2yLD3esBneRzDI4Uh26q-A	Z4wqE0K0w3lOHMY4jVBqwA	I like this place.  The food and the service is great.Sesame Crusted Big Eye Tuna with tahini sauce - I love it!  The sauce is so nutty and tasty and goes perfectly with the tuna and mixed greens.Rock Crab Croquettes - it's their version of crab cakes but they deep fry the croquettes (4) and they arrive at your table piping hot.  They're delicious! - reminds me of my beloved dungeness crabs back home.   Shrimp and Spicy Coconut Sauce with crushed peanuts - this is pretty good.  It's very similar to Thai food.Hangar Steak with bean salad in bleu cheese & miso dressing - both times I've had it it's been a little tough and very chewy.  The bean salad (scattered around the steak on a long rectangular plate) drenched in the dressing is quite good.DESSERTSWe ordered the Sample Platter.  I'm glad we did because we were able to try some really interesting desserts.  This Platter is perfect for two people.Yuzu (Japanese Citrus Fruit) Panna Cotta - a little more firm than normal panna cotta.  Didn't really taste the citrusy fruit.  But it was very good.  It kind of reminded me of a smoother version of cheesecake without the graham cracker crust.  It also had a drizzle of some berry compote.Strawberry Spring Roll w/Honey ginger ice cream - I really liked the spring roll.  It was nice and hot and I think there was some sweetened sticky rice in it as well.  I'm a big fan of ginger but for some reason I didn't like the ice cream.Honey Black Sesame Creme Brulee - this was not my favorite but it was interesting.  The creme wasn't super creamy but had a little texture to it.  The color of the creme was a dark charcoal grey and tasted like smokey sesame.  It's a clever idea but not something I would try again.Kabocha (Japanese pumpkin/squash) Cheesecake - pumpkiny cheesecake with cinnamon or nutmeg with maple syrup lining the plate was my favorite.

It even beats the places in DC that I've tried, and they do a cool new take on  rolls.  Everything was fantastic, my date and I ate 'til we were stuffed...then had dessert on top of that (a delicious creme brulee).  At $10 a roll, these are more than worth the price..they are huge and come with their own individual sauces...no wasabi or soy needed.  We had a saki flight...not my thing, but good to try once I guess.  Service was great and I love the atmosphere.  I can't wait to go back!"	AfoBKJuGBJvQhc3By4K9Dg	5	2006-10-22	0	0

0	237EL2sEpc-ZUEbo0HUYGQ	pubTy2GEizrk1Es638wgIA	Muramoto is a very good restaurant if you enjoy a limited selection of very good things.  The duck roll is outstanding as are the oyster shots, which are my favorite way to start dinner.Criticism-wise, there is a bit of a problem with seating in the wintertime, as there is quite a draft coming in from the door if you sit too close to it.  Moreover, you cannot make reservations at Muramoto.  This means of course that you cannot request a table further away from the door if you want to in advance (first come first serve).Service is just fine, ambiance is lovely.  Come with a date, not your kids and definitely not in your red UW sweatshirt.  Dress to impress; this is a spot for grownups only.!!!!!!UPDATE!!!!!! Downtown Muramoto has moved to an new location, which is interestingly just down the road from their old location.  This solves the drafty chill issue, there are LOTS more seats, and you can now make rezzos.  On the downswing, it's missing something of its original, uniquely Madisonian charm.  It now has vaulted ceilings, adequate lighting, and at least one waitress of questionable moral character.  Plus they have an additional location by the Hilldale Mall which is yet another step down.  I think what I'm saying is that Muramoto sold out to the man and is now no longer actually hip or trendy.  But honestly, it's still quite nice and the food is very good.  The new Hilldale location does not have the oyster shots, but they do have a delicious octopus salad which knocks me sockies off.  You might as well keep going.

Some of the teachers are cool though such as Ms. Gazier. Take her if you take honors chem. There's also Mr. Barkdoll. He's always funny and makes math really fun. Another teacher would be Mr. Bailey. Very easy going guy and an easy A if you show some effort and not be obnoxious. Some of the stuff isn't mandatory, such as Pep rallys, just sleep in and go to class 15 minutes before the pep rally ends. Basically, just enjoy high school on how easy and how little responsibilities you have before going to college.	PnHxk6TozuSFXmlWjoLpdA	4	2015-10-19	0	0

After giving this place and my nail tech Kim business for over a year, I was turned away today because I like my nails buffed too much. Seriously? You mean you don't want to ""work"" for the money I pay you. WTF? I've never been so insulted. And I'm not even a difficult client. In the year I've been going here, Kim has barely said two words to me (which is Ok. I just want my nails done). I continued to go back week after week because she was good. Six months ago I walked in without an appt and let someone else do my nails. Mistake. She cut me and the buff was awful. Kim actually stepped over to finish the job. And I tip well for good service. So understand how floored I was when I was told today Kim doesn't want to work on me any more. I was told her arm hurts too much after buffing my nails and she feels awkward. You're kidding, right? Now, if I was a jerk customer; demanding, loud, lousy tipper, etc I can see it. But I'm none of that. In fact, when I find what I like, I'm loyal. And I've been loyal here. And I pay without complaint. And I tip well, always. That's why I'm so pissed to have been turned away because the job is too difficult. That's just lazy! Yes, L-A-Z-Y!!! You perform a service.

I called prior to actually going to the salon to find out prices as well as make an appointment. The girl who answered the phone took about 5 minutes to figure out what the cost of a basic pedicure was. Then I scheduled an appointment for 11am on Sunday. I get there just before 11 and no one greets me, I finally get the attention of the girl who answers the phone and let her know I have an 11am appointment for a pedicure. She says oh okay pick a color and we'll be right with you. I wait 10 minutes, then they have me sit in a pedicure chair. Another 15 minutes waiting for someone to finally become available to do my toes.  Holly did a really great job, but waiting 25 minutes after I made an 11oclock appointment is disappointing.  I go to pay and the girl who answers the phones also takes care of the payments. She seriously had no clue what she was doing. She asked me what it cost and I said $22 as It stated on the menu.  This girl up front really has to get it together, she is completely clueless. I am sorry to say I won't be back to this establishment.	cOWBLBde6AAwzBDuoa85Ag	2	2017-06-20	0	0

Clean salon and disposable liners in foot tubs Appreciated that they soaked my acrylic off instead of trying to ""pop"" them off . Tina did both my hands and feet and both are completely on point . Not to mention she took extra care and detail , plus the massage was amazing . I like that they offer a menu of ad ons for their pedicures as well , I love options . I will be back to this salon and will book an appointment with Tina again . Thanks Guys !"	cOWBLBde6AAwzBDuoa85Ag	5	2017-03-11	0	0
0	NYiE3COjlFtU0huNlkPt8w	-C5-uwUvwKanEQYSEyIAeQ	love this nail salon. i read the reviews on yelp and decided to try.  each experience has been positive, i've been going every 2-3 weeks since march.  i generally get a pedicure and gel manicure.  I haven't had the same technician twice but i always walk out happy with my nails and toes and get loads of compliments.  the have great selection of gel/ shellac/ gelish polishes, can almost always find colors that match the regular polish near perfectly. prices are good, they have different pedicure choices you can add on and different types of pedicures to encompass all their different services. go during the week!  their weekends are insanely busy, you will have to wait and your services are good, but much better during the week.  that being said they like to take their time during the week.  sometimes its helpful to let them know you have a bit of a time crunch.  (my last gel manicure and pedicure i was there for just over 90 minutes)  i appreciated the time and enjoyed the break, but i know sometimes that much time is too much to spare.	cOWBLBde6AAwzBDuoa85Ag	5	2013-06-21	1	0

0	iJfnk3trvpModWj2V-zpnA	i61h1HHTO0OWXZwhEncqcA	Last week was first visit to Fancy Nail.  It is clean, they use disposable trays for pedis.  The pedi was nice, good massage, lots of colors to choose from, offered bottled water.  One of my toes got messed up from her putting my flipflop back on, but she fixed it right away.  I also had an acrylic nail fill with gel polish & top coat.  She did a good job of keeping them thin, nice colors to choose from, although they longer use Shellac.  I never felt rushed the whole time I was in there and everyone was nice.  However, when trimming my cuticles, she cut mine & it was bleeding~Not Good because No nail salon puts new tips on their drill for every new customer :(I think I would go back for a pedi but def not for a nail fill.	cOWBLBde6AAwzBDuoa85Ag	3	2014-01-28	0	0
0	MSNhl-hEylIRk9mC5gUs_g	g7CqiOoJBdlQbMHMRnNXOA	I just moved to Phoenix and decided to try this place out. It's very clean, lots of colors to choose from, and close to my house. Every time it come in here they seemed very rushed and try to get you out of the door as quickly as possible. No room for relaxation. One time I did back my nails done by Steven, he's by far the best and takes his time. I'll probably be branching out if I can't reserve with him in the future.	cOWBLBde6AAwzBDuoa85Ag	3	2014-04-19	0	0
0	qyQdqgoSW-inYUdmvQfJzA	0gYj10HFOxNHgNxFw5l5yw	Still getting great service several years later! I've never have a bad experience here, even when they are packed with customers.To those that are especially particular or love a more pampering experience and for the tech to take more time with them, try going during the week and during the day. If you like extra pampering, why would you go at the busiest time? It's common sense to go when they don't have a lot of other people to distract them and common sense to not go at the end of the day when they are exhausted and ready to go home, especially if you are a walk-in. That is with ANY business.  Their busy time, btw, is weekends, especially late in the day.	cOWBLBde6AAwzBDuoa85Ag	5	2016-01-28	0	0

0	WAq-LUcfZJMy_eYfYXpYCA	b4O1WjOxBBCVggeiPHzEEQ	I often travel to Phoenix, but I've never been able to find a great nail salon that's the trifecta: clean, reasonably priced, and does great shellac...until now. I called to check to see if I could come in without an appointment and was able to get in right away. I was greeted by the salon owner, who removed my old shellac and then prepped my nails. His next appointment arrived, so he sent me over to HaLee, who did my nails. She was awesome - precision shellac, super-nice, and very quick! The salon is very clean and tastefully decorated. The cost of the manicure was very reasonable, considering what nearby salons were trying to charge. I'll definitely visit again! Very happy.	cOWBLBde6AAwzBDuoa85Ag	5	2014-01-21	0	0

I had to go to several different shops here in Arizona, since moving here 17 years ago, before I found the right one. I was very happy at that salon for almost 10 years. During those 10 years, I went to the same nail tech,for about 8 of the 10 years,he dida great job, my nails lasted, and all was well! For personal reasons I had to find a new salon.So I went to a new place, it had high reviews and I got a new set and a gel pedicure! Everyone was nice and all looked okay, but they were so SLOW I was there 5 HOURS!!...I couldn't imagine ever going back there again, they were closed for over an hour, and I was still in there , the ONLY 1 in there!.....Not fun! So I was stressed after that  , and knew I needed to  find a new place so now I am in the present time, and brings me to my review here today.  I took my time,and for 2 weeks,  I really did my homework. I researched, googled. read reviews, and finally decided on where I would go.  I chose Fancy Nails & Spa on Cave Creek Rd in Phoenix.  I didn't just make an appointment either. After I was done with all my research , I called about  4 of  the salons,  and went in person,  to see the salons, and speak to them, as well, as look at there selections of powders / colors. When I first called Fancy nails I spoke to the Owner David, he was very friendly. He offered for me to come in, and take a look, and told me they would take care of me, When I went to the shop, again he was friendly, I decided to make an appointment. For a new set and gel pedicure with Kim also eye brow wax.They didn't have the chunky/confetti powder that I am used to, but assured me they could order at a later time.My nails seemed okay, I was just glad to have them done, and have found a place, that I didn't  pay to close attention.As the holidays were fast approaching and I was very busy at that time. The gel pedicure was good looked nice. But I was a bit disapointed that my, toe nails were grown out so quickly, as I had said please make them extra short, I like them short. And even after she first cut them, I asked her to trim off more, glad I did, because they were still to long. I figured though it was my first time, so next time it will be better. I always got compliments  on my nails, especially the last 10 years. Well all of a sudden no one is complimenting me?! I thought that is really strange?!After a couple days I looked harder at my nails and I could see every little mark under the pink area?...and it looked weird....they never looked like that before. . I had them use medium pink, same thing I had always used, for 10 years . Then still no compliments, and each day they looked worse... it was like you could see all the drill marks straight through it, on my nail beds. I went back to my next appointment because now new years Eve was here, and I had a party to go to. This time the same thing happened with my nails, and my pedicure also. Now my daughter is asking me whats wrong with my nails?...And even my husband!. They don't  look nice anymore, my husband says. I wanted to cry. So I called the nail salon and spoke to David the owner, he said come in and he would take care of me himself.So I did, and he said they needed to be removed, and cleaned up underneath, and a whole new set, and he would take care of me, and he did!...:) So now everything will be okay..right?wrong!!....It helped,  But he had to drill my nail beds way way down a lot and it hurt real real bad to do that!...I had another pedicure by a different tech, once again I explained they were left to long  2 times, and I like them extra short,  make them very short. They said yes but, they did not.After 2 weeks ( and still no compliments) I was beside myself. So I made my appointment with David again, thinking Id try one more time. And when I got there I showed him all the drill marks on my nail beds. He then showed his daughter Hannah, and had her do my nails.She said would do back / fill and use ""her"" medium pink powder.  and it will cover all those marks. She then proceeded, without saying anything to literally rip off my finger nail, it hurt!. I pulled away, in pain, and said, no! you need to soak them off!..and she laughed!! and said I was sensitive and begin to rip again!.OMG!I couldnt believe it now there was BLOOD! and a huge throbbing pain she laughed again! I had tears It hurt for the whole time, she was not even sorry.When she was finally finished, They looked good, so I thought it might be Okay Well wrong again! 2 days later 1 nail was lifting!..I called Hannah.Can she please fix it? She said to busy!!..Maybe tomorrow!!?? I got really upset. Then she said ok come in.The owner David looked at it, he fixed it, and never said 1 word to me the whole time.I knew right then, I would not be returning. Next day another nail lifted and came off 1 by 1 til all are gone just shy of 12 days! OMG"	cOWBLBde6AAwzBDuoa85Ag	1	2017-03-20	0	0
0	ALK9WBaokEtmotik0RepTQ	-wlzNwfH69QbN3qry2zWig	I was looking for a nail parlor that was close-ish to my area, and this place by far had the best and most consistent reviews. Called to make an appointment to do my gel nails, and the man on the phone was very clear about directions. Upon arriving there i can absolutely see why people might get lost. They're tucked into the back of a complex on Rose Garden lane. Easiest way to get there would be to turn and go east onto Rose Garden lane and then turn left (north) into the red brick complex. They're straight ahead of you there. It's a nice new place, and was pretty busy when I got there, even though it was 1000 on a Saturday and they had only opened at 0900. Most people were actually there for pedis. Since I had an appointment I was seated almost right away, and they got down to removing my previous gel manicure and get a new one on me.I do have to make a disclaimer- I hadn't always had a great experience with gel nails. I did them for my wedding and loved them, and went back to get them done after they grew out, for a bachelorette party in Vegas. The removal process was horrid- they used this thing to scrape the stuff off and it felt awful. And then I left, went shopping and literally in an HOUR had a giant chip. Of course there was no time to go back and get it fixed. It was a very disappointing experience.But getting mine done when I was out of town had been pleasant, and my best friend said she was addicted to them. So I decided to give it a shot again. And I'm glad I did. The removal process here was quick and painless- the gel manicure crumbled off when it came time to scrape it off, no awful sensations necessary. They had a great range of colors, and my lady even tried to recommend another color for me. (I wound up sticking with the color I wanted). The nails were beautifully done, and she did them promptly- I was in and out of the place in under an hour. I did decide to wait about a week to do a review, to see how well these puppies wear. The manicure I had prior to this chipped a bit on the thumbs within a week, which was also a bit disappointing.A week and these nails look as good as they did when I left the salon. I'm hard on my nails too- I pound at a keyboard, and have two big, rough dogs at home. These still look great- no chips, wonderful shine. I think I might have found my newest addiction, and I'll definitely be back to get them done again! Please do note that you can pay with DEBIT cards, but not credit. Also, like several reviewers noted below- bring CASH to tip.	cOWBLBde6AAwzBDuoa85Ag	4	2014-06-29	2	0

They just moved the salon a few doors down to a bigger spot, which has better air ventilation(no nail odor).  I usually come with a big party because they have plenty of room to accommodate us all.  I get SNS and a pedicure which last me about three weeks.  Highly recommend this salon.	cOWBLBde6AAwzBDuoa85Ag	5	2017-07-18	0	0

0	3-pqtVa42oESLX8_90XzTg	oIxBBbqCsMoNuUzEchEeiQ	I'm a business owner myself. I made an appointment the day before to get a gel pedicure, and a back fill. The reviews I read were really great. I'd been seeing the same nail tech for 6yrs and never had I complained. However she moved to California. They put me with a guy that didn't speak any English. I get my pedicure & nails done every 10 days. this young man took 90mins doing nothing! He put callus remover on my feet and then place them in the water Hmmm... I wonder where he got his nail tech license? He didn't remove the skin or calluses on my feet after putting callus remover on them. The shape of my toenails are not the same or even. Oh! And he forgot to massage my feet!! Then the owner came over and told me that they're really busy and couldn't do my nails and could I come back tomorrow and he would do a very good job on my nails for me!! I sat in that chair for 90 minutes frustrated with this moron that shouldn't be doing pedicures or any other kind of service. It was inadequate & way below average customer service. I watched the owner book appointments for ladies that just walked in with no appointment and ask them to come back in 20mins. Well I dealt with being stressed out by someone that was not properly doing their service then being told that they didn't have time to do my nails because they were too busy! I was charged $48 for something that I most certainly was not happy with. I told the owner to stick it up his A..How can anyone be so rude I don't know? I wish there was a law or a requirement that in order to get your license to be a nail technician or to perform any kind of public service that every individual of any race needed to speak and understand The English language fluently before they were able to obtain their license!  I owned 2 hair salons in scottsdale and I don't ever recommend anyone going to fancy nails.	cOWBLBde6AAwzBDuoa85Ag	1	2016-10-17	0	0

Last week I called to schedule an appointment.  After waiting 20 minutes with feet soaking & water now cold-I asked how much longer it would be.  The lady beside me said she would be doing my pedi & it would only be a few more minutes.  I understand a delay, but what's the point of making an appt. if you wait that long?  Once she began my pedicure she seemed to be rushing.  I have 3 places on my feet where she rubbed with the pumice so hard that she burned skin off like an abrasion.  This was on Sat, today is Monday & it still hurts & has not healed.  I will find a new salon.  Wish I knew the ladies name & I would post this!!!  I told her it was hurting so she stopped rubbing so damn hard.  After she painted my toes, she put antiseptic on the worst burn-that only made it burn more!!!  Terrible service...unsatisfied	cOWBLBde6AAwzBDuoa85Ag	1	2014-09-08	1	0
0	EkvFZ7vHwEpkKGY5-WeaUQ	DpwR9r16eiMec0BMALlAWw	Fancy Nails is a great place to go when you are in a rush and need your nails done.  Firstly when you walk in they assist you right away, and soon enough your in your seat.  Let's say you got gels they would check every coat before putting it in the light. And they turn out perfect!  They also have a great coffee machine and water.  The people are super nice and great at what they do. It is also a very clean shop which has super comfy chairs washed supplies and the nicest polishes. So be sure to go to Fancy Nails, the nicest and neatest nail salon on earth!	cOWBLBde6AAwzBDuoa85Ag	5	2014-11-23	0	0
0	seXjsuewdnh8-y8Ruow-Kg	T8Y-sDeLHhoKFWBEMob1VQ	Very disappointed with the pedicure I received. It was extremely rushed and lacked the sentiment of pampering yourself and relaxing. It was not meticulously done and there was nail polish left on my skin. I  can definitely do a better job myself. In addition to that, the nail technician cut my big toenail at an angle to the inside on each side of the nail, and it looks absolutely ridiculous. It was only that one nail so my overall pedicure is inconsistent. I brought it to her attention even though there was nothing she could do to change it and she brushed it off and said that's how it's done.	cOWBLBde6AAwzBDuoa85Ag	1	2014-11-02	0	0

So this review is from not your typical girl who gets their nails done routinely. I probably do it once every few years lol. Upon arrival, this nail salon looks very fancy and clean. Their tools I think are packaged and their prices are pretty standard. This place is also the 1st time in my life to get my nails done by a guy 0.0I think the techs there are nice and friendly and they explained to me any questions I had like what is difference between gel manicure and regular ones. I believe there is a pretty big selection of colors to choose. Since I'm not an expert, check out my pics and see for yourself! :)Also, they provide free coffee and candy. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was because my legs became a mosquito buffet but it's not their fault and it's pretty cool there with ceiling fans turned on.	cOWBLBde6AAwzBDuoa85Ag	4	2014-10-10	0	0

The second time I came in and it was horrible!!!! I asked for a full set of acrylics. I got seated with the male tech. At first he was very nice and then when I asked for them to be a certain length he told me no and that that was ugly! I was so offended! I asked him again to go shorter and he refused. I finally picked a color and he did a horrible job. The color came out so streaky. I left and my nails looked horrible. My cuticles were still a mess, the lengths were all uneven and the polish sucked. I'm never going here again!!!!	cOWBLBde6AAwzBDuoa85Ag	1	2015-12-05	0	0

0	tsXlmhcm5I43HrWvzrH9ew	Os9pnsmw71rCWgToKKQGXg	Terrible!! This was my first and my last time coming here. I came for a relaxing pedicure and dip powder manicure. I sat for my pedicure in between 2 ladies who were already well into their pedicures yet mine was done way before theirs. How is this possible when I got the same services they did? I asked them what pedicure they got and it was the same as me. Maybe because a guy was doing mine and he seemed to hate his job.  Hm... mine lasted about 15 minutes their pedicures lasted at least 30 - 40 if not more. Then I sit for my powder manicure. It was so bad I had the girl remove it. It took her 3 times of soaking my nails with the foil to get the gel off, that's how thick and awful it was. As I leave they charge me for my pedicure, ok fine, yes I got a pedicure, here's the kicker, she charges me $10 for a cuticle trim!! Are you serious? I left and immediately called my bank to dispute the charge. Worst customer service ever!!	cOWBLBde6AAwzBDuoa85Ag	1	2017-05-10	0	0

As if that wasn't enough he was rude about it claiming they charge him too many fees. I will not return.	cOWBLBde6AAwzBDuoa85Ag	1	2017-05-10	0	0

I had a full mani-pedi and an absolutely thrilled with the results.  I believe it was Jessica and David who helped me and they were both friendly as can be.  Hannah also was great.

The owner runs a very tight ship and not very many people are talking, it's very quiet, the staff are very attentive and it's very relaxing. The place is very very clean. I will make this my nail salon now, it's reasonable, friendly, clean and relaxing, what more could you want?	cOWBLBde6AAwzBDuoa85Ag	5	2013-10-23	0	0

I went on a wed afternoon so was pretty quiet and they were able to get me in right away. Pedicure was very nice, massage was long, they offered me a bottle of water, normal prices, clean place, and friendly staff. My only complaint was they didn't have me sit under the lamp to dry so after I got home I noticed one if my toes was smeared. Luckily I brought my own polish so I could touch it up. I will be going here again.	cOWBLBde6AAwzBDuoa85Ag	4	2013-11-20	0	0

This is the first salon I have been to in a long time where I don't have a specific technician work on my nails.  Every person in the salon does a great job.  I am fortunate to be out of work before 3pm during the week so I can get to Fancy Nails by about 3:15...I've never had to wait for a service when I arrive around that time.  I have been on weekends and it does get busy, so I'd recommend you make an appointment.  The salon stocks OPI shellac/gel polish in addition to some other brands I don't recognize. A gel manicure costs $25. For all of my pedicure people, Fancy Nails uses disposable pedi tub inserts so no worries about someone else's foot funk touching your tootsies (big plus)!  They have a few options for pedicures, so ask to see the menu before you start.  They also offer waxing services and tanning as well but I can't comment on them since I've never used them.The salon is clean, well stocked, and everyone is always professional and courteous.  There are plenty of other nail salons closer to where I live but I choose to come to Fancy Nails.  They're everything I was looking for in a nail salon!	cOWBLBde6AAwzBDuoa85Ag	5	2016-01-11	6	4

Got there and it was not as if anyone had just been seated -- they didn't skip a beat with getting folks in prior. So, we had to wait. No one looked up and acknowledged us. Waited until 5:00, when we were finally acknowledged and we had to mention the appointment time that has long passed.My daughter asked for shorter nails twice and nail tech did not listen. 5:45 and still here. Frustrating.Tips: 1. Honor appointments. 2. Greet customers as they walk in. 3. Techs need to listen to their customers and also consider their age. My daughter is barely 14, and asked for shorter nails but did not get what she asked for.4. When nail techs aren't busy, do not sit in front lobby area on your phone with headphones on all kicked back.	cOWBLBde6AAwzBDuoa85Ag	3	2017-05-02	0	0

0	TK7208ZMWAERUUY2dEtD6w	rDVCSa019LijFvOT41-KrQ	This is my go-to spot for mani-pedi's and brow waxing. They do a bang-up job on my poor feet because it takes a lot to get those pups looking good. I have never made an appointment but never had to wait more that 3-5 minutes to be assigned a nail tech. They recently got new massage chairs that don't grind your bones or shake you to death like some chairs do. Also, this is one of the best places I have been for a brow wax. My sensitive skin has taken a beating at many other places but never here. I don't know anyone by name but the employees are all very nice and skilled at what they do. Oh, and they are typically $5 cheaper than anywhere else I have been for pedicures!	cOWBLBde6AAwzBDuoa85Ag	5	2010-02-03	6	1

1	tJO7401VdiZw8qlR7W52Bg	HrzzQj0KfR_MI68flznBLg	Amazing place downtown Oakville that makes you feel very welcome and has a downtown Toronto feel.  It's open a bit later than other places in Oakville therefore it's great for the night owl crowd. I've been there at least 3 times and there is usually some party going on.  Later in the evening they play music and have the most interesting Japanese Anime or Sumo wrestling on a big screen.  The food is authentic and high quality.  Their rolls are amazing.  But what makes this restaurant such a hit is the personal staff and bartenders who make everyone feel like a regular.  They greet everyone in Japanese.  I'll be back!	ykSlMTRgyWzAmhP7ywc9gg	5	2014-01-04	0	0

The honey topped eggplant was quite good but everything else was mundane at best.  There were rubbery little pieces of octopus with much chopped vegetables in a sauce that overwhelmed everything. There was spicy salmon which was not spicy and was overwhelmed by a massive amount of mayo.  The tuna was tasteless. Etc. In addition, the decor is primitive and the place is incredibly loud for a supposedly upscale restaurant. It is simply not a good restaurant and I would not return.	ykSlMTRgyWzAmhP7ywc9gg	2	2013-09-23	1	1
0	TUu4SppnJ1S3lQ_jTxMpOw	xkVmcvD1A2qAMG75fC-miQ	What a gem! I'm so happy I wandered into FIn! Since moving to Oakville I've been searching for as many Toronto-esque restaurants as possible so i can get my fill! I've found a few great places there, but no food (especially Asian) has actually been that great - until Fin! I went here on a Sunday evening, and was concerned it wouldn't be open, but it was until 10 PM. We were greeted in Japanese and seated immediately by our extremely friendly and attentive server. Food is a bit on the pricey side, but without there being much competition in terms of Izakaya in Oakville, I wasn't surprised, and it didn't break the bank. Personal favorites were the selection of fish for three (see picture, so beautiful!) and the Eastern Style Caesar (who wouldn't love a drink with a crab leg in it!).Overall i was super impressed with the quality and variety of food, as well as the service. I couldn't recommend Fin enough to those starved for a bit of Asian food in Oakville!Disclaimer: If you're from Toronto and eat Izakaya all the time, this might be a touch pricey for you!	ykSlMTRgyWzAmhP7ywc9gg	4	2013-09-25	1	0

Was recommended by a friend after telling her how much I loved Guu but I definitely can't listen to her anymore! It's a nice looking place and the service was good as well, but the food comes first and it definitely was lacking. Sashimi was on par with AYCE places, not what you expect when you pay 40 bucks for 16 pieces. Overall, not pleased with my food experience.	ykSlMTRgyWzAmhP7ywc9gg	2	2014-08-02	0	0

Sauvignon Blanc from Chile was good and can be recommended. Cucumber Addiction tasty, avocado tempura very good, sashimi 3 kinds flawless, fresh raspberry point fresh oysters excellent value at $1.50 each. Shichimi duck salad also very good.

A good thing to see with all the For Lease signs that have been cropping up lately.If someone could translate what is yelled at patrons once they enter, it would be greatly appreciated.  I'll assume it is a greeting.  The friendly staff that helped us explained that the general restaurant experience is that of arriving, eating and then leaving to go enjoy something else, somewhere else.  The Izakaya experience is designed for you to eat, drink, socialize, etc. all under one roof.  Hence the loud and sometimes frantic atmosphere.  Pretty much a tapas menu.After perusing the Sake menu, my wife and I settled on some Sapporo, mine in the bath-sized glass.  It wasn't that the Sake menu wasn't impressive, but my wife doesn't love it, I have limited experience with the Gekkeikan brand and I just wasn't in the mood to take a chance on a 3 oz, $15-30 sake that I may or may not like.  Maybe if I'd have been encouraged or had some sort of crash course I would have considered.Any way, food:In absence of a bread basket, you are given what is called thin spaghetti, coated in salt and flavoured with a spicy curry.  A little strange a different as it is like eating spicy uncooked spaghetti.  Started with the Cucumber Addiction - sliced pickled cucumber with sesame seed and oil.  A great clean-tasting starter.  All orders come out fast and furious, but staggered so as not to bung up the table too much.The Pork Rib Kakuni was really good.  3 fall off the bone pork ribs that are slow braised and served on mashed potato with a spicy mustard for more flavour.  This was really tasty and a good portion of meat for only 3 pork ribs.The Soy Bean Cream Crab Croquette is a mouthful.  Resembling arancini balls, but stuffed with crab, there 3 little guys are filling and have more substance to them than your average crab dish.The Tuna Carpaccio is delicious with a savoury mixture coating the fish.  A little tricky to pick up with the chop sticks, as it is chopped rather finely, but worth the effort.The Deep Fried Prawns are quite massive and heavy on the garlic, but the spicy sauce make 'em quite a lovely plate and pretty to look at once delivered.As the evening progresses, more and more residents of Oakville filter in.  There is a lot of bumping and jockeying for room in this narrow little space.  Conversations can be heard from basically every table.  The fake-chested table were amazed when Barbie's shorter sister came in, no less than one month after giving birth and back to her fighting weight.  A quick cat walk, a twirl and they're sat beside us.  Yaaaaay.This is where service fell apart.  We had one more order coming and we were contemplating another round of drinks and possibly dessert.  But with all the air-kissing going on and the place getting louder and packed, the person taking our orders came back to our table after 15-20 minutes, stating that he'd forgotten to enter our last dish.  Another 20 minutes later and the special of the night Cod we'd ordered arrived.  It was incredible and naturally buttery.  Any aggressive thoughts were forgotten instantaneously.Food for Thought:  if you come for the special catches of the day, come early.  4 of the 6 fish specials were sold out by 7:30.  And the Blowtorch Mackerel?  It may be delicious but smells of burnt arm hair.  Maybe its just me and my wacky palette.Hopefully the ""trendiness"" wears off in the passing months.  The food is quite good and staff are helpful, sincere and very knowledgeable with the menu.  It is the clientelle that I could do without."	ykSlMTRgyWzAmhP7ywc9gg	4	2013-07-08	1	0

She does hairdressing because it is her true passion. Even when we were down in the dumps she pursued her career energeticly and industriously. Not for money, leisure, or narcissism. She is extremely talented and near obsessed with what she does. It's a rare thing to find someone who loves what they do. Needless to say, she is an excellent colorist. She loves to try anything fun, new, and exciting (even though she tugs on my tender head ;) ) Anthony is also incredibly talented. As a former T&G instructor he knows what he's doing. He is extremely precise and meticulous when it comes to his work. It's not just a hair cut to Ant, it's art, and he wants you to feel exhilarated when you leave. Even if I say I'm going home to drink beer he'll spend and extra 20 minutes playing with my hair to make it look fantastic.I love you guys, keep up the good work xoxoxoxxxo	zoq5SERVEDBd7MaKPjlLJA	5	2014-08-28	0	0

Demi has not only saved my hair from damage, but always takes my hair to the perfect shade of blonde. Before seeing them, I was told by someone at Regis that it wasn't possible for me to be blonde.

Tried the bruschetta, chicken parm and cajun salmon. Every dish was good and the chicken parm was better than many spots in the area. The one negative was the hostesses attitudes.

0	GYNnVehQeXjty0xH7-6Fhw	Z7wgXp98wYB57QdRY3HQ3w	Wow. So surprised at the one and two star reviews!  We started with the most tender calamari. Although the marinara sauce was a bit bland, but a touch of salt made it just right. My husband had the veal with peppers and said it was so delicious and tender. The mashed potatoes were perfect. I had the salmon Diablo which was also delicious. Our salad was beautiful! Dressing was served on the salad and it was a nice amount. We ended our delicious meal with a piece of tiramisu. Our server Matt was right on!! Very pleasant and knowledgeable about the menu. Our appetizer, salad and entrees were timed perfectly. I love salad and did not mind that my entree was served while I was still eating it! No problem it let my dinner cool to just the right temp for me to eat it comfortably. I wonder sometimes if people just don't appreciate relaxing and taking time to eat a wonderful and beautifully prepared meal.  A wonderful atmosphere. So relaxing. The chairs are super comfortable too!!! We will certainly be back. Give it a try.  Don't  always go by the reviews. A bottle of Riesling, calamari app, two delicious entrees and dessert for $92! Well with it.	FxLfqxdYPA6Z85PFKaqLrg	4	2016-05-07	0	0
1	fttIbxIx4_zre4zOUGiqCw	-k0u6krCe0vkJL-RKlEMtw	"Came here trying a new place. Literally! Just opened two days ago and well worth it! Warmly welcomed at the front by a nice hostess, and we're told we could even have a seat in the bar. Since we were interested in the Pirates game, it worked out, they have a few TV's in the bar for such purposes. We ordered our drinks; Prosecco & Malbec. Both by the glass. Our server gave us big glasses of water with out drinks so A+ there. The bread came out first and it was awesome. Perfectly warmed, large slices, crunchy crusted Italian bread that tasted like it was made in house. Served with ambient temperature butter (another pet peeve of mine is ice cold butter) so A+The salad came out next and was the first area where we'd recommend a little change, maybe a little larger for sharing between two. But it was flavorful, cold, and dressed just right. The fresh cracked pepper added to it so overall: BNext our entrees: I had the Three-Cheese Lasagna my partner had the Gambellini Fra Diavolo (sorry if I misspelled it.) they came out at just the right temperature and at the same time. I tried a bite of his dish and the Diavolo was mild, but with a ""back-of-the-throat"" heat which is perfect. So: ""A"" for his dish. My lasagna was rather impressive, and I didn't realize the recipe was total cheese lasagna, but it was delicious. The only downside would be a personal preference of a little more herbs or spice in the cheese mixture. The tomato  sauce was slightly sweet and tasted of homemade. So well worth trying! Overall the reason behind the 4-star review is only for the slight downsides, but again, could just be my personal preference. I highly recommend coming here to try it out! Great ambience and extensive menu."	FxLfqxdYPA6Z85PFKaqLrg	4	2015-09-10	0	0

The seafood Rollitini was ok but under seasoned.The strawberry mascarpone cake, basically tiramisu with strawberries instead of chocolate, was just good not great. Service was ok but given the lack of a crowd should it should have been better.It was not the best but far better than a chain store.Would I go back probably yes at least one more time.Suggestions to the owner.1. Stop seasoning for old white people or at least offer to kick it up2. Go to a team waiting model to give more attention to customers. 3. Make us customers feel special not by cupon for free wine but giving a shit, talk to us treat us like we are honored guests.4. Keep the seasonal menu going. 5. Offer old fart seating at 4:00 to 5:00 ""give cupon for buy one pay 1/2 price for second "" you can offer the bland ""Special "" then."	FxLfqxdYPA6Z85PFKaqLrg	3	2016-10-10	0	0

We ordered off the restaurant week menu.  We both loved the lobster bisque.  My husband's crab ravioli was not warm.  My veal romano was hard and difficult to cut and eat.  My vegetable, carrots, were also not soft enough to chew. We enjoyed the ice cream for dessert.  The waitress was very friendly and attentive.  We may try Pazzo' s for lunch, but we wish we would have chosen a different restaurant for dinner.	FxLfqxdYPA6Z85PFKaqLrg	2	2016-08-22	0	0

The decor/environment and the service is the only reason I can give one star.  It was all downhill after that. I say all the time that of you can't get the basics right you can't get anything beyond the basics right. So we ordered two basic dishes-fettuccine Alfredo and Spaghetti & Meatballs. We chose to skip appetizers but a family style salad was brought to out table. It included a few cucumbers, a few grape tomatoes, some purple onions and a few croutons. There salad was cold but there was nothing memorable about it. We were also served 2 slices of bread. Again, nothing that stood out. The entrees were brought out while we were still eating our salad. It was awkward. When we went to eat our entrees they were room temperature. The meatballs were over cooked, dry, and didn't seem to have any seasoning. The spaghetti sauce tasted like tomatoes and not much else. I was extremely disappointed. I also tasted the fettuccine. It too lacked flavor.  The fettuccine noodles were inconsistent. Some were cooked to the correct consistency but some were hard. We skipped dessert because we didn't want to take the chance of eating anything else that lacked flavor. It's safe to say that there won't be a second visit.	FxLfqxdYPA6Z85PFKaqLrg	1	2015-09-16	5	1

This place tries really hard to seem fancy, but falls far short.The bread was fantastic, but it was paired with ice cold, solid butter.  The salad, as others mentiones, had very little nearly-flavorless dressing.  I had the chicken marsala ($18).  The three chicken tenders that comprised it were tender.  The sauce, however, was a mess.  It was as if they splashed some marsala wine on the plate, and then dumped the chicken onto the plate, oil and all, straight from the sautee pan.  It was sweet, watery, spotted with oil, and devoid of any kind of seasoning.  Oh, it had a few sliced mushrooms, too.  I chose pasta with white sauce for the side.  Bad move.  It was pasta tossed in plain white sauce - no cheese, no garlic, not even a bit of salt.My wife had the shrimp scampi ($22).  It came with 4 or 5 shrimp that were actually quite big.  They weren't overcooked.  The sauce, again, was a watery mess, a bunch of butter quickly thrown together with some white wine.  The whole thing was topped with *garlic powder*.  I don't think any of it was seasoned with salt or anything else.  She chose broccoli for her side.  Aside from the bread, the broccoli was the best part of the meal.Come here if you're looking to spend $20 a plate for food that's below even Olive Garden's standards.  The service here was slow and unenthusiastic, and I'm willing to bet that none of the cooks have ever actually tasted the food they're sending out.I only gave it two stars because the food did not make me sick.

I had the eggplant Parmesan, which had too much breading & was bland.Another person in our group had the Greek pizza, which was thin & crispy & bland. On the bright side (I guess), the kids liked their chicken fingers because, hey, kids like their food bland!	FxLfqxdYPA6Z85PFKaqLrg	2	2015-10-11	2	1

We were in a hurry on a Friday and there was an hour wait at Bonefish so we decided to try Pazzo because we wanted to since it opened. The parking lot was pretty empty and very empty inside. I guess now I know why. They seated us immediately and then nothing. We saw other waiters at other tables and people cleaning up and nobody even looked at us. It was like we were invisible. They weren't even busy. After almost 15 minutes we got up and left and my husband told the hostess we would not be coming back. I have never been ignored in a restaurant before but now, based on the reviews, I'm glad we didn't waste money on the food.	FxLfqxdYPA6Z85PFKaqLrg	1	2016-03-14	0	0

The portions were generous, however nothing was seasoned properly. Shrimp Scampi was covered in garlic powder sitting in a bowl filled with microwaved butter. The broccoli was the best part of my meal. They were cooked to perfection. The salad that's given lacked any dressing. The dressing was bland. The beer is over priced. $9 for any craft beer. I could see if they had a 10% DuClaw on draft for Pazzo's to have a reason to charge that much.The service is depressing. Servers don't smile here or seem enthusiastic. Perhaps it's because they feel guilty for being the poor souls to serve below average food for such a sky-high price. The decor is nice. That's it. Now save yourself money and go to Chick-fil-A next door.	FxLfqxdYPA6Z85PFKaqLrg	1	2015-10-03	5	1

After a few minutes the waiter stopped by to have us remind him what beer we had ordered... We placed our order for food and he brought out a ""family style"" salad. Bad lettuce with a couple of poor cut onions slices. There was 4 of us and they served the table of 2 next to us the same salad. We asked for me and the snotty waiter slammed a bowl of just lettuce on the table a few minutes later. The funny part was they give you a gallon of dressing per person.. We decided that since it was the new place in town we would order a few apps so that we could try it out. But, using some caution we stuck to the basics -- Calamari and Fried Zucchini. Both were dripping grease and had zero flavor what so ever. Luckily I had lots of the Lemom Basil dressing left from my salad to give the Calamari the citrus it needed (never been served Calamari without a lemon to squeeze on top). The Zucchini was so soaked in grease none of us could eat it. They didn't clear off the table so at this point we are overloaded and there was no room for the bread that was brought to the table. Unfortunately we made room for it and it was the most stale bread I have ever had. Perhaps I was mistaken and they brough us croutons to go with our lettuce?I'll wrap up with the entrees. I had ordered the ""lightly breaded"" veal chop with arugala and they served a disgusting piece of veal with a heavy and burned breading. No seasoning was involved. I opted for the starch and I was hoping it would be a pasta but instead if was a bowl of red skinned potatoes that had been given a butter bath. I literally poured the butter from the top before I could even tell what they had served me. I could have used these potatoes to apply wallpaper the place--gross. My wife was served cold, undercooked pasta and shrimp without any seasoning at all. It was supposed to be ""diablo"" but zero spice . She had two bites and was done. One guest ordered a side of chicken to go with his pasta and 5 minutes after his pasta was brought out they showed up with a bowl of shredded chicken.. a literal WTF moment.. The last meal was salmon and just to wrap this up was an awful piece of fish with no flavor -- same butter drenched gross potatoes..We were honest with the waiter when he asked how everything was but he was more interested in being condescending in between smoke breaks. The manager does not have the skill level to deal with this type of complaint. She tried to make it better by taking the chicken off of the bill and offering a free desert.. And after all of this our bill was almost $200.... what a joke. I hope the place that goes in here next is better -- shouldn't be long."	FxLfqxdYPA6Z85PFKaqLrg	1	2015-10-18	5	1

Our entrance less than a.warm greeting by a young blonde girl at the host stand. ""Hi, just two of you?""not all that welcoming. Brought to our seat and was not informed of any daily specials. Was not presented a wine list but asked for one and got a not to impressive small list. Who has lambrusco on the menu? This place does. Opted for a mixed drink since wine choices were slim. Had the bruschetta. Appetizer. Nothing to write home about. Bland, no seasoning. Wife had pasta with salmon. Salmon was small tail end piece that was overcooked and dry. I had veal and peppers which was dredged in too much flour and not shaken off before sauteed. Asked for bread twice before i got three small slices that was told just came the oven, (cold). Asked for warm bread and finally got it as i was taking my last bite of veal. Also had to ask for water twice. Needless to say i had a subpar meal and terrible service. I usually give a place a second try but since both meals were average on a good day and no wine selection, we wont be back"	FxLfqxdYPA6Z85PFKaqLrg	2	2017-03-19	1	0
0	skSf0o3ba3sBZ_3Olxp_4Q	9O3ET_tLiuBfPbV4UF9zdQ	My wife and i went there for the first time on Saturday night, decided to sit at the bar. We waited for 5 to 10 minutes without being acknowledged by the bartenders, even though it wasn't very busy. When a bartender walked by us without even saying hello, we decided to get a table.A waiter named Brandon took care of us, but his service was mediocre. He had to be reminded that we had ordered a second drink, the food was just warm, and not very good. (Chicken asiago and veal marsala) He never asked us if everything was ok after the food was delivered, didn't ask us if we wanted dessert or coffee, and didn't even say thank you after he returned the check after the payment was made.Overall, we were very disappointed with our experience at pazzo. We will not return or recommend it to our friends. It was overpriced for the quality of the food and service. Olive garden would be a much better value.	FxLfqxdYPA6Z85PFKaqLrg	1	2016-01-16	3	0

I am gluten free and my daughter is egg and dairy free and she was able to guide us to the best choices. The kitchen appears to be careful about food allergies and cross contaimination.

1	yRaaXNFgqnZesfMyw0GclA	0glKaP0H84XJxCORugfbxg	The worst dining experience I have ever had.  The food was decent, although some people in my party were unable to eat their's as it wasn't cooked thoroughly.  It took an hour and 20 minutes for us to get our drinks.  When they first started bringing out the drinks, the waitress mentioned she had not yet placed our dinner order, which we had given her an hour before.  Someone from our group searched out the manager and found him in a back corner of the restaurant hanging out (turns out he is also the chef).  He basically ignored them.There was much confusion, wrong drinks were brought out, not all appetizers were brought out.  At 9:00 (we got there at 6:30) we couldn't find our waitress to get our checks.  Finally at 9:30 she appeared with all single checks.  Not all checks were there, and she basically just put them on the hostess stand for us to sort through ourselves.  A member of our party had to search out the manager, who said he was just about to come over and see how our meal was.  We had no signs of him until we had to search for him.  This was by far, the worst dining experience I've ever had.  Anytime I drive by, the parking lot is empty.   I can't imagine it will be open long.  If only the chef could back up his arrogance with his culinary skills.	FxLfqxdYPA6Z85PFKaqLrg	1	2017-01-24	2	1

Four of us went on a Friday night and were seated almost immediately.  Ordered drinks and 23 minutes later they show up.  Dinner was bland and not even italian food...Pesto should at least have pine nuts and basil right?  Mine was tortellini with olive oil and parsley.  The service was slow and even after we complained no one came over to say a word or find out what they could have done better. Oh, and a kettle one martini was 12.75  For ketel one and some vermouth.  WOW.   There is no way that the mgmt cares about this place based on all the other reviews.

When we mentioned we didn't order a double, she said it was a computer glitch, but made no effort to reduce it. Asked for a manager, he offered to take off 4.00. Buyer beware!!

0	ZnIaEvJwrxlBUjimIpx2Qw	M57psk3w8Tykb9nrbQ7bPA	If you're going to charge $16 for manicotti and a $2 up charge for the WAY too salty wedding soup, I expect more... I have no problem paying for good food and if this food had been amazing, I wouldn't even mention the cost, but it's far from that. I normally get manicotti at Italian restaurants my first time there and maybe if I'd done that, I'd like this place more, but I doubt it, since there was barely any sauce with my crab ravioli and I didn't like the flavor. I know many people like bell peppers, but I'm not a fan. If I order crab ravioli, I expect to be able to taste the crab - the consistency of the crab was also very strange - it was mushy. My dad's linguine with red clam sauce barely had any sauce and the sauce that was there was SUPER runny - it looked more like died white clam sauce than red clam sauce. At least they used real clams, but neither of us were impressed. I wish Stone Pepper Grill hadn't closed.I'm REALLY not a fan of the Olive Garden, since there are so many better Italian places, but I think the food is better there, you get more, and it's certainly not as pricey... Of course, there are many much BETTER Italian restaurants than that (like Pasta Too, etc.), but if I'm saying the Olive Garden is a better choice, you know the food was not very good.A couple more thing I forgot to mention in my review... I had to practically beg for parmesan cheese and what I got wasn't fresh or even nicely grated from a container... It was the same kind of parmesan I have at home (though probably not even Kraft... ha ha ha...) it was in a dish and they spooned it on for me. I didn't even get any to go with my soup, since I didn't want to ask for it then. No cheese was EVER offered.They seem to turn their air conditioning completely off instead of down when the restaurant is closed, so it was INSANELY HOT in the restaurant until we were almost ready to leave (we went there for an early dinner, since I met my dad right after work to avoid traffic). Someone should explain to them that this actually costs them MORE money and it makes guests uncomfortable, so it's bad on all fronts. AVOID this place at all costs. Here's hoping they don't last long so a better restaurant can open there.	FxLfqxdYPA6Z85PFKaqLrg	1	2016-08-24	1	0

My wife and I sat at the bar to order drinks and contemplate dessert. It was ten minutes before our order was taken. Second sign. Drinks were poured, took five minutes to find a lime for my wife's drink. Third sign. We decided to skip dessert. We could tell as we looked around, wait staff was poorly trained and disorganized. This place needs help. Beautiful interior, and like I said - did not try the food. But with the number of good Italian places in Pittsburgh, come on - need to up your game!

Stepping into this place, it's an enigma wrapped in an enigma. Sholay isn't heavily advertised in your face so you don't know what to expect. The restaurant name brings memories of the legendary movie and elite characters. Come on. Don't tell me you can't hear Amjad Khan's voice :) Enough of me being Basanti . The place has: a large poster of Shah Rukh Khan, a pic of the Dalai Lama , and generic scenery pics. As you walk in you are promptly greeted by two American white people. The instinct as a desi is to run away but please resist this urge. You find out the staff, are owners and chefs who love desi food.

There are three or four Indian curries on the menu. We got the chicken curry. The guy (there was only one person there, to cook and work the counter, but they weren't busy, so hey) said it was really good. If you're desi, you know what shan and all the boxed masalas taste like, and this definitely had that taste. Not saying it's a bad thing, but fresh masalas give a curry an aroma that this lacked. The chicken shish kabob was bland, except for the red chili powder added liberally on top, and it wasn't actual shish kabob. The best thing I had was the lamb burger. Oh my gosh. The lamb was super juicy. And the fries already had black pepper. Loved it. The place is super duper clean. Even the bathroom. Like I said, there was one person to cook, serve, answer calls, and take orders. He told us the others were out for a catering. This is in no way true Indian food. The shish kabobs aren't Indian shish kabobs, but rather Middle Eastern kabobs, the naan isn't true naan, either. Don't go to this place expecting awesome Indian food.

My only complaint (almost 20 minutes for one to-go order with only 2 or 3 other customers at the time) was the waiting, but the employees were nice and made sure to let me know that I wasn't forgotten.  The shish kabobs were tender and savory, and their balsamic vinaigrette for my salad was the best I've ever had!!!  The saffron rice was also delicious even though it appeared to be the item that was delaying my order.   I should've called ahead, but next time, I want to try their lamb burgers...  Limited menu but top quality ingredients, yummm!3/12/14I returned there after work to pick up my lamb burger and side salad to go.  The ground lamb meat was indeed tasty, but I was disappointed by the smallish size compared to the bun.  I'll stick with the kabobs and rice in the future.  I was told by the nice man behind the counter that they'll be expanding the Indian portion of the menu in a few months so here's hoping they add samosas!	bzUSbd9YLoK3egnTkXFd1Q	4	2014-03-07	0	0

The basmati rice was also spiced in a subtle way that complemented the meat.

I had heard about it through yelp but didn't expect to try it out anytime soon. I was taken back by the fact that the owner of the place was not Indian! He was VERY friendly though and so I give this place a 5 for customer service! After having asked if the meat was halal, the owner told us that everything was halal except for the beef pepperoni. I'm very grateful that he not only verbally stated it, but has it written down on the menu as well. We weren't really starving so we placed an order for halal wings & fries as well as the pizza naan (with chicken, cheese and pizza sauce). He asked us if we wanted him to make it spicy, and like most Indians and Pakistanis, OF COURSE we said yes. So he made added chillies as well. Fast forward to the food - the halal wings were GREAT. Spicy, but a little too breaded. My bf noticed this as well, and was the first one to point it out. The fries came out extremely salty, but I finished the majority of them anyways. The pizza naan was good! Especially if you like chicken keema! The chillies the owner added made it spicy and quite scrumptious. The best part of our trip to this place was definitely the MANGO LASSI. The owner gave us each a sample which led us to ordering one. The lassi was thick, unlike many other places you order a lassi, and you could taste the yogurt. YUM. The owner also gave us a sample of the rice pudding, but I wasn't that big of a fan. I'm not the biggest sugar addict but I just wasn't feeling it. I hope to come back for the lamb burger and the lassi next time! Overall, this isn't entirely ""Sholay"". If you are looking for Indian (as in""desi khana"") food, go elsewhere. If you are looking for American styled Indian food, this is your place."	bzUSbd9YLoK3egnTkXFd1Q	3	2014-04-02	1	0

I was immediately greeted and handed a menu, which has American breakfast specialties on the front, and inside is a small kabob selection, naan pizzas, and burgers. Very odd combination of offerings.Ordered the chicken kabob platter to go, and was offered a breaded chicken wing to sample while I waited- they are trying out new menu items. The wing was huge and mostly composed of breading, which is not what I'm looking for at all when I'm ordering wings. Flavor was okay, but the wing itself was just weird.Got home with my food in a reasonable amount of time and it was nice and hot- the kabobs were delicious, and my BF snagged a few bites even after devouring his sandwich. The rice in particular was very good: I'm not one to rave about rice, but it was moist and flavorful, and had some white, some yellow, and some orange in it- likely a combination of white and saffron rice, with additional seasonings. The naan and salad were also fresh, and the portion was generous, and on par with the $10 total. Best part of the meal was the cilantro sauce for the kabobs- it was killer. Highly recommend, get it on anything.	bzUSbd9YLoK3egnTkXFd1Q	2	2014-03-02	3	0

But once you start ordering appetizers or any of the other entrees, it can get pretty pricey pretty fast. I didn't think the mussels were anything out of the ordinary really -- and I was surprised to find cilantro all over mine (usually it's parsley when you order a shallot, butter, and white wine sauce). This wasn't on the menu so I had to try and pick the cilantro out. The one must-order here though I would say is the grilled scallops with butter appetizer. It's juicy, buttery, slightly sweet scallops on the shell -- and probably my favorite thing here.	g_fGPZJlGeKGLgC-j-tj6w	4	2017-06-07	0	0

0	K5h_G-hGAkskrhqfW6l4DQ	v6taWbXFF0a0r096qR3RNw	I ordered mussels with ginger/lime sauce and they were the best I have ever eaten. For £12.50, the portion was huge (may be 30 or more) and the sauce was more like soup at the bottom. It was spicy and delicious.	g_fGPZJlGeKGLgC-j-tj6w	5	2015-06-28	1	0

We split a bucket of mussels (shallot cream white wine sauce) and I had an 8oz ribeye - the husband had something weird like pasta.  The mussels were the best I've had in my life, truly amazing, and the steak, skinny little thing that it was, was delicious also.  The quality of the local beef and seafood spoke volumes - no extravagant preparations or sauces required.Highly recommend.	g_fGPZJlGeKGLgC-j-tj6w	4	2014-05-21	1	0

The date was going well (oh la la) so he suggested stopping by this place for dinner. It was a Friday around 730 and we didn't have reservations, but we were able to be seated for a table for two. The manager was cheeky and ribbed my date a little bit for pretending to look in the reservation book to pretend to be someone else, which was very amusing. We were able to sit upstairs and I thought the place had lovely ambience. We started with some fried goat cheese balls and garlic grilled mussels. Honestly, I'm not a huge fan of mussels but I thought ""When in Rome!"" and tried them. They were really tasty, but I'm not sure garlic was the best date choice! Anyway, for my main I had a special fried plaice with black pudding mash that was extremely tasty. My date had a steak that he enjoyed. Topped off with a nice glass of house white and I was a happy camper. I will definitely come back to The Mussel and Steak for another nice dinner in the future when I'm in the area, which of course I will be because I do love BrewDog..."	g_fGPZJlGeKGLgC-j-tj6w	4	2015-03-24	3	3

Started out with Arran Smoked Salmon with Potato Scones, Crème Fraîche and Chives, the salmon was so fresh, it melted in your mouth. We also split a kg of the Scottish Mussels, we chose Shallots, White Wine, Garlic & Cream sauce, don't forget to order some bread to dip into the pot and soak up the goodness. This was probably one of the best mussels pots I've had. Call and make a reservation if you can, we waited 45 minutes for a table (we went over to the Bow Bar to pass the time). If you can, sit outside, great people watching, right in the heart of Grassmarket.	g_fGPZJlGeKGLgC-j-tj6w	4	2013-09-08	1	2

It was during Scotland's unexpected (and sorely missed) heatwave so we sat outside - a rare treat in our climate. We were the first diners when we sat down but by the time we left the place was full and there was a great vibe. Now to the food. Me and my dad both opted for the same thing - the surf and turf. This consists of a Rib Eye Steak served with half a kilogram of mussels cooked in your choice of sauce, crevettes and squid rings. Being a big fan of Asian flavours I opted for the chilli, ginger and lime sauce. We also ordered some buttered new potatoes on the side to add some carbohydrate to all the protein.When the dish arrived it was amazing. Perfectly cooked steak (medium-rare for me) sitting on a mountain of seafood - not many things could look so appealing. All the seafood was full of flavour, the sauce had just enough heat and the Corona with lime just added to an amazing meal.Next time I'm in Edinburgh I will definitely be making a return here (I hope the heatwave will too).	g_fGPZJlGeKGLgC-j-tj6w	5	2013-11-28	6	5

They have a pretty reasonable lunch and even dinner deal if you want to fine dine on a budget. I had the steak and it was great! So good and nicely flavored and cooked just right. The mussels are great! They have a Thai inspired flavor which is not bad if you want something different. I do recommend getting the French fries fries in beef jus. It's good and so much better than their plain potatoes.	g_fGPZJlGeKGLgC-j-tj6w	4	2015-11-28	1	1

The decor is basic but the great tasting fresh food and friendly service more then made up for it.  All the food was fresh, vibrant and flavorful.  Our group tried the seafood platter, the special lobster dish, curry mussels and the surf and turf combinations.  No one had a complaint about any of the dishes.

But the specialty has to be the mussels. Choose a mussel pot and have it in any of five ways to suit your palate and mood, just take your pick. Depending on how hungry you are choose a full three course, or share a divine starter and dessert. All this with great service, good price and fresh atmosphere.	g_fGPZJlGeKGLgC-j-tj6w	4	2007-08-30	0	0

0	nhVvcPyRGLw466qHVbUjrA	U7wIblaF05QkXCKbGVIfOg	I come here. A lot. Either with my mum or with friends (usually to celebrate a birthday) this has become a personal favourite eating place. Firstly, it does good food- whether you are into seafood or meat. You get to watch your food being cooked on a screen (which is slightly odd) and I love the layout of the ground floor- quite modern without over doing it. Look out for the fun facts about mussels in the toilets.The service has always been super friendly at this place. Being in such a prime location I was expecting shocking prices but I was pleasantly surprised. They have amazing lunch deals and I have never walked out of this place hungry.Sadly they only have one vegetarian option as far as mains courses go. Also, in the winter the upstairs floor tends to get really warm. Aside of these hitches Mussels and Steak Bar is a good standard for me.	g_fGPZJlGeKGLgC-j-tj6w	5	2010-05-31	1	2

They were also happy to oblige my dairy intolerance, which was nice. Both the seafood and steak were good quality, but I guess they were just a bit boring. Boyfriend wasnt so keen on the strange warm, limp cabbage on the side of the steak. Although the steak was cooked as ordered (medium-rare) which was good. The queen scallop starter was OK, but the scallops were quite small and over-salted. Mussels were pretty good. Overall a decent meal, but not good enough to get us over to Grassmarket on a regular basis.	g_fGPZJlGeKGLgC-j-tj6w	3	2013-11-24	0	0

1	SxV1Jq7UANuSYpn42JXvOA	t0f4p1JLscASG2LZD13MCA	Everybody in my family likes something different. My Dad likes Italian, my Mum French, myself Indian and my sister Chinese. The problems it causes when we each want our restaurant to provide something different. As a comprimise, we often decide that a restaurant serving British food is the best option - but then its time for the real battle to begin. Light and fresh sea food or good and hearty steaks?It seems then that I should introduce them to Mussels and Steak Bar - which, as you would expect, serves Mussels and Steak.Its no secret in the restaurant that the produce is local (or at least Scottish) and the ingenious menu combines seafood and heavy meats in brilliantly tasty ways. The sauces used are outstanding, if a bit 'out there' and incredably mouthwatering (In fact my mouth is watering as I type).The restaurant itself is simple and practicle - and despite the annoying big screen TV's - has a seaside town feel to it,matching the down to earth cooking style. The staff are friendly and helpful, while the bar offers a large range of drinks.So there you have it, a restaurant which can cater for all appitites and in a mouthwateringly excellent way.	g_fGPZJlGeKGLgC-j-tj6w	5	2010-04-14	1	1

2	3jjiY5D7oIlKeiCIZGHQew	BBUGwYfheR4YJL_77_o55A	I must say the name of this restaurant is straight to the point and those two things are exactly what my friend and I ordered. The steak was alright, I've definitely had better, but I will say that the mussels were pretty damn good. Very flavorful and piping hot when they arrived at the table. They weren't as good as the ones I had in Belgium, but they definitely weren't bad, and there was also plenty to share for two people. The restaurant itself isn't all that fancy but their service is. They make sure you're taken care of throughout the entire meal. Oh, you must get the Banoffee Pie. What's better than Banana + Toffee + Graham Cracker Crust. Absolutely nothing. It's heaven in your mouth.	g_fGPZJlGeKGLgC-j-tj6w	4	2012-12-13	3	1
0	ZgMiIZC1sH6giDYVNpx_XA	bIOQ7AOyi7BWGT_9buM0Zw	I don't like mussels.  They are too strong and too fishy! Don't care for the smell and don't care for them in soups or stews.  Until now I would have told you that I'd rather eat rattlesnake.  Appearantly in Scottland, there is an entirely different species of mussels.We stopped in at the Mussel and Steak Bar for dinner before walking up to the castle for the 10:30 Tattoo.  Our travel mate ordered the mussel starter.  It arrived with green sauce on it.  OMG, it smelled amazing.  So much so that I had to taste it.  The little mussels were tender and steamed to perfection with a light pesto sauce driselled over them.  It is such a great combination!I had the surf and turf for dinner.  The mussels were done in white wine and garlic and the ribeye steak was tender, juicey and cooked exactly as I ordered it. All four of us agreed that our meals were delightful.

We ordered from the lunch menu - 1 course £7.95, 2 courses £9.95 or 3 courses £11.95.Most of the group ordered starters & the haggis dish was the most popular. I saved myself for the 6oz rump steak which was awesome. The chips were chunky & crispy, just how I like them & the mushrooms were earthy & full of flavour. My steak was perfectly cooked, moist & melt in the mouth. A colleague had the seafood curry. It was full of enormous mussels & other fishy delights. It smelled amazing & he said it was the best fish curry he's had. The only problem being that it took so long to arrive he didn't have time to finish it before having to get back to work.Unfortunately the service was slow and I we all had to skip dessert & coffee as we needed to get back to the office (despite being there over 90 mins).A lovely lunch with great food & company. It was a shame the slow service meant it was a wee bit stressful.

1	jcNeSuL83hbsHyFDnbfHvw	V5RxjppLE-M_nFgIF2xFnw	One of the best spots for seafood in Edinburgh, and one of my favorite restaurants in the world. Located just across the street from a longer strip of restaurants and pubs in the Grassmarket, it would be possible to pass the Mussels Steak Bar without giving it a second thought. That would be a huge mistake.I've made about 12 trips here for lunch and dinner, and every time I've always been greeted by an unbelievably friendly waiter or waitress. They start you off with some of the best crusty bread and softest whipped butter you'll ever taste, and they are happy to replenish it many times over.My favorite way to start a meal is with a kilo pot of their mussels, which are all ridiculously fresh and delicious, particularly with the white wine, shallots, garlic and cream sauce. Both the steaks and the seafood pasta (with loads of mussels, scallops, prawns, and calamari) are excellent main courses, and their fries with 'beef dripping' are some of the best I've ever tasted. Their wine list is not huge but offers good selection at reasonable prices. The meal can definitely run on the pricey end depending on the conversion rate (if you're an American) but I have never walked out of this place unsatisfied.

The first surprise is that a reviewer is surprised to find that Scotland, the north part of Great Britain (a well known island), has decent seafood. The second, and more disturbing, is the complaint that a restaurant with the name ""Mussel and Steak Bar"" has a fairly short menu. One might have thought, nay expected, that the menu would be mainly ...On a positive note, what I can say is that they provide first class food. What they say they do they do well.

0	yaBIVHDxaUBN2YHQ8-YiuQ	d9kdJMmc_wOBh9Kv-9GK3g	Came here with family for dinner on a Saturday night. We booked in advance, but the place wasn't terribly busy in the end. The atmosphere is quite formal and a bit quiet, rather than bustling and busy. I went for the red curry mussels, as did my husband - my parents got the traditional with shallots and cream. The servers gave us the wrong mussel pots which took us a while to figure out, as all the sauce collected at the bottom and wasn't really coating the mussels, so we honestly couldn't tell whose was whose initially. We had to take some of the huge portion of mussels out and put them to the side, so we had space to use our spoons to coat the remaining mussels in sauce. Once we managed that though, the mussels were very tasty and fresh. The sauces were mild, but added a nice subtle flavour to the dish. Sides were decent but basic - slightly soggy fries, steamed seasonal vegetables, nothing terribly exciting. The price can't be beat though, at £14 for an enormous meal.Not the most memorable of meals, but an enjoyable one. I think a loosening up of the atmosphere would go a long way.	g_fGPZJlGeKGLgC-j-tj6w	3	2017-04-13	0	0

I still have fond memories of those nights spent with my house mates and when we get together now and then, someone always brings up a pool related story or joke.Walking into Petrina's Taps and & Billiards for the first time recently, the similarities  to my old pool hall brought back old familiar memories of my University billiards nights. Everything from the sounds of laughter or someone racking up a new game, to the smell of the velvet table tops mixed with tap beer and mixed drinks. Even the dimly lit room seemed all to familiar. I loved it.Arriving later in the evening, my friends and I were unsure how long we would be playing for and didn't know if we wanted to pay the hourly rate of $15/Hr (even though it was very reasonable). Upon expressing this to our server he recommended that we use the $1/game table. What a deal!! With the average game of pool taking about 5-15 minutes why wouldn't we explore this affordable option?!Several libations later we had played 8 games over 2.5 hours, saving ourselves $37 by playing the $1 tables. We didn't even have this kind of deal when we were students!Pool is not something I regularly play, however if I am ever in Ajax again with a hankering to play, I'll be sure to head back to Petrina's with a pocket full of change.	lxR1ub7Gapwg_Doh7kqqIg	3	2012-06-02	2	0

Some of the cues have cracked tips but if you look, you can usually find one worth playing with. Monday and Tuesdays they have $5 pool from 6pm to 11pm (although I think that's gone up to $6 recently)... either way, you can't complain about that. They have a fully stocked bar and will make tea and coffee on request for those of us who don't drink. They also have a half decent menu with food that's prepared downstairs at Texas Burger (yum).  You're pretty much in view of a TV wherever you are and they have a large projection TV in the lounge area allowing you to sit, eat and watch the game. I'm not saying it doesn't happen but I've never seen a rowdy crowd here and although I've been to better halls, this place is okay for a fun night out.	lxR1ub7Gapwg_Doh7kqqIg	3	2013-12-31	2	1

The School has lots of different age students from when the child is potty trained to kids taking their SATs to adults learning Mandarin.  They even have water activities on weds and Fridays (weather permitting).  I am happy to drop off my kid to school. My kid has learn how to speak basic Mandarin.  There are lots of non asian children in school. Most teachers are bilangual. Lots of mixed asian children too.  The school is very focus on safety.  You need to be buzzed in to get into the building. Each parents sign in and sign out during pick up and drop off.We (including my mom who is a former teacher) checked out three different pre kindergarten for my child and felt this was the best one.

We chose three businesses on the west side of town to start with.  Elite A/V was the only business that could be bothered to qualify us as customers and after about an hour of talking A/V with Carmine and Jeremy we had three quotes THAT DAY!I needed to convert my old ""tube"" TV niche so I could hang the plasma on the wall.  During this remodel project Elite A/V sent a team out to pull some new wired networking runs and they were able to complete this task in one day.  A couple of return visits to patch up the holes and you can't tell they were ever here!  The price was very reasonable and the job was finished quickly (much quicker than I expected) and professionally.We had asked Carmine to give us three quotes and a budget cap to work with and when Carmine told us we would have quotes same day I originally thought that was a bit optimistic since we met with them later in the afternoon...but sure enough after dinner I had quotes in my inbox.  This is the kind of service we received from Elite A/V over and over, when they said they were going to do something they did it and always on time.  We decided to go with Martin Logan Eloctrostats and a Marantz receiver to replace our aging equipment and I will say it is impressive, the warmth, depth, and clarity is hard to imagine until you hear it.  This was an A++ purchase at a reasonable price and we are one hundred percent satisfied.We are looking forward to our continued relationship with Elite A/V as their customer service and quality of service was unmatched by others we talked to during our remodel project.Five Stars from Robert and Stephanie"	GnGjeLuG4EmjcYrhHlvP7Q	5	2017-07-23	0	0

We found them on Yelp (thanks Yelp!) and from the very beginning they were on top of it.  They were fast, efficient, courteous, and clean.  But more importantly, they know what they are doing and are true experts in their field.  We shopped a few companies before choosing this one and on top of everything else, they beat the other companies price!  Very happy overall and will recommend them to everyone.

I finally narrowed down my choice to Jeremy and his team and that turned out to be the best decision in the world! Jeremy came by to check out my loft and we brainstormed ideas for my home theater. He was very knowledgeable and left zero doubt in my mind that I'd picked the right company. Jeremy and his team got my projector ceiling mounted and my 110 inch screen up in no time. He threw in a video receiver and two ceiling mounted speakers to complete the perfect home theater for me and my family! He even installed a new outlet so I could hide the wires on my living room television when I asked last minute. That was icing on the cake that made a person like me who rarely writes, just reads reviews, make sure that I shared the experience I had with this company!

The experience was pleasant, great attention to detail and absolutely no damage to my home. The mess that was inevitable with any A/V install was meticulously cleaned up by the team.  This company strives to be the best and will work with you regardless of your budget. I will stress however if you are looking for a superior system do not skimp with inferior components.True professionals and will spend the extra time to make sure you are completely satisfied with your system and truly understand the operation of your new system and control before leaving.

I was't even planning on putting a home theater system for my house until i talked to Jeremy, who was highly recommended by a close friend. Long story short he stopped by my house we did a walk through together and he really took his time to explain the different possible options we had based on quality of the products and my budget. He wasn't pushy and made me feel real comfortable. Next day i received an amazingly priced estimate and decided i was going to do it. Him and an associate of his stopped by on the date we agreed on (on time) and knocked my whole home theater system out in less than 5 hours. What made my experience even better was the fact that he was more than willing to teach me how to use my brand new pioneer receiver. All and all they made my life a lot  more entertaining. I have to admit i did spent a bit more than i had initially planned but it was worth it. I will be calling them back for more stuff, highly A+++ recommended...

0	ey8MLFh2g55NMIgq33hPeA	AwLQrozoTx3YBKrVKX0w8Q	I sent an email to Elite A/V LLC to see if they could give me an estimate to hook up a new blue ray, to an older home theater system and new tv.  They replied back to me within minutes saying it would probably be around $99.00 which I found acceptable and scheduled an appointment for the next day.  They arrived on time and explained that because the home theater system was so old they could not connect the new blue ray to it but could only connect it to the TV.   Since that was not a good option for me I declined and they were kind enough to not charge me for the service call.   I then thought about purchasing another home theater system but they suggested that I use the existing built in ceiling speakers.  I had originally not wanted to spend what I thought would be a lot of money to hook those up but after further discussions with Dylan I agreed this was the best route.   He was able to provide a receiver and sub-woofer for me or I could have went out and purchased my own.  I verified based on his quote and the cost was no more than what I would have paid at Best Buy.   We rescheduled for the next day for the install and again they were right on time.  Kevin and his partner came out and completed the installation in about 2  1/2 hours talking us through the whole process.  They had to cut a small hole in the back of the entertainment center so they could attach the wires which I was at first not crazy about but it was very small and behind a closed door so it was a non-issue.  The cost came to more than what I had intended to spend at the time but I am so glad that I went with their suggestion.  The sound is fantastic, I don't think we will ever go out to see movies again.  I would highly recommend Elite A/V LLC as I felt they were very honest in explaining our options and we did not feel pressured at all on the direction to go.	GnGjeLuG4EmjcYrhHlvP7Q	5	2016-07-01	0	0

They cleaned up after themselves and did a fantastic job.  Sometimes when strangers come into your house, it can become awkward.  In this case, we cracked jokes and were able to still maintain an efficient time frame.  They suggested some things for the future as well.  I would recommend them hands down for any work.

0	owrNd439iiqvh9POeJQ_Ig	6IpPwu8f0LnpwpP2ojb9zQ	Chris and Jeremy are great. They installed a 4 camera system (with ability to run 8 total) in my home after my wife wouldn't stop nagging. The system is real nice. They installed two flush mount screens (about size of smaller computer monitor) in both my bedroom and family room area. The screens turn on and off with a switch, and run a constant 4 screen split view of all my cameras. The whole camera thing is silly to me if you aren't able to view them in a moments time when someone rings the bell, or if you hear something strange. Sure, everyone's able to look on their phones - but the monitors they put in are amazing. Full HD quality, and great picture. I had some minor issues with my first NVR. It would reset in the middle of the night, and when I woke up my screens in both living areas were reset. I called Chris and he was back the next day. It turned out there was a small update on the NVR that wasn't done prior to sending a small shipment of NVR's out.  A new one was sent via the manufacturer, and we had a new unit installed 3 days later. Both very nice guys. Professional. Nice equipment. They take their shoes off. They pet the dog. All in all, good experience and have recommended them to a neighbor (after recent break-ins in the subdivision -- 3 in total).	GnGjeLuG4EmjcYrhHlvP7Q	5	2015-04-28	0	0

I called because the picture on my smart TV would go black if I even moved the receiver a fraction of an inch. Also I couldn't get Netflix audio to play through my surround sound. I called the office around noon today and the technician, Dylan, was at my door at 4:00 pm. Dylan was as professional, courteous and knowledgeable as it gets. Within 10 minutes Dylan had run a new HDMI cable inside the wall, switched some connections and presto now Netflix audio was playing through my surround sound! All that was perfect but it got even better. I asked Dylan about television options outside of the cable companies. We talked about Roku for streaming various shows and channels. Dylan was kind enough to offer to come back another day and set me up with Roku at no extra charge (outside of the cost for the Roku itself) as he had only been there about 20 minutes out of the hour I was being charged. Well it turned out that Dylan had a new Roku in his truck and 30 minutes later Dylan had helped us set up an account and explained in detail how it worked. Dylan even loaded some free channels for us. I'm an older guy, in fact I think I have some socks older than Dylan but he was extremely patient and courteous in explaining everything. Now I can really reduce or even eliminate my Direct TV bill. Incredible! Please use Elite A/V for any home theater needs you may have.I can't recommend them any higher and can't thank Dylan enough for his assistance.	GnGjeLuG4EmjcYrhHlvP7Q	5	2016-06-02	0	0

It came down to Elite and another company. All of them were pleasant to speak to but Dylan with Elite really listened to me, worked with me on my budget and found something that I'm very satisfied with. I didn't need anything on the high end and had him install a 5.1 speaker system that fit right in my budget. Dylan called me the day before to confirm our appointment and also called me about an hour before arriving as well. As a business owner and service provider this is a practice that I find invaluable to both the customer and the vendor. Upon arrival he took great care in covering up all my furniture and electronics to insure a clean and complete install.He installed 8"" 5.1 speakers to my receiver for TV, Blu Ray and X Box which I absolutely love! He also hooked up my turntable. Everything was calibrated to my liking. Dylan even walked me through activating my sub-woofer which I accidentally shut off after he left.

1	LEQGiJqnHEdHakj40WO_vA	LqIyw5ZKKBApLjOvsLkhAQ	The Best Audio Video company I have ever experienced.  They are LICENSED, BONDED, INSURED.  These guys are Professional.  Jeremy took my call and had his crew come over the same day!  They diagnosed an existing custom home speaker system and mounted the TV's very quickly.  The team was prepared, clean and respectful.  They made sure they did not leave until the system worked perfect.  They checked all the TV/Blue Ray/DVR settings to make it work the way I wanted.  It is a large crew that can handle big or multiple jobs.Workmanship is really great.  The wires were run in the wall on both applications.  They have decades of experience!!Value: Their prices are very fair for the quality of work (Excellent)!I highly recommend Elite A/V LLC.	GnGjeLuG4EmjcYrhHlvP7Q	5	2015-06-25	1	2
0	JwfUQmNUUQwiVdQfhpQ6ww	_28D4J_9deipnsuoeoR0zQ	I used amazon services to get connected for the Elite A/V team to mount my TV. They did an awesome job. The Elite A/V team were amazing. They were professional and  courteous even removing the shoes upon entering the house and vacuuming a small amount of dust up when done. It was clear they took their time to measure everything out and assist in making suggestions on where to place the TV. For any future AV or home automation, I'll definitely give these guys a call.

They were very fair with their estimate and did a great job in a timely manner. The camera system is awesome. I even have real time access from my iphone which they set up for me. (This is great when you want to see what your employees are doing while you're gone for lunch). Chris and Jeremy are both cool guys and will give it to you straight. I will use them again in the future.	GnGjeLuG4EmjcYrhHlvP7Q	5	2016-03-01	0	1

We have paid other techs to do the same job but the wires were still left in a mess. This time we finally found someone who knows how to do the job right. Jeremy and Maurice are coming back in a few months to change out the ceiling speakers with new larger and directional speakers and have given us other options for updating our 7 year old system. If you have any TV or Sound system issues call Elite no job is too big or too small. Great company.	GnGjeLuG4EmjcYrhHlvP7Q	5	2014-06-25	1	1

I had been looking for a while for someone to mount my new television for me and everyone I found was either too pricey or just didn't seem professional enough. I spoke with Jeremy at Elite AV and he was kind enough to tell me over the phone which type of mounts I would need as well as what he sold in comparison to the retail stores. I trusted him merely from this phone call and when he came a few days later for an installation I knew I made the right choice! Very professional and very knowledgeable!!Thanks Jeremy!

0	OtoCNQSiG-xHf35lUsolNw	yduDCONn6bwo8QKcVtSDYg	I got a great deal on a high end 12 camera security system but needed someone to the install and found Elite A/V LLC on Angies.  I messaged them and Jeremy replied within 24 hours and we made an appointment for a walk around. Our place is single story with a large foot print at 3600 sq ft and I wanted full perimeter and entry coverage. We have vaulted ceilings in over half of the house, with very little attic space on that half so running cables is no walk in the park.Jeremy and his crew were always very polite and professional and I am very happy with the work they did,  They did all the camera cabling, setup the dvr and did some upgrades to our 2gig alarm system. I feel I got a very fair price on the work that was done.I plan on adding 4 more cameras down the line and will definitely use them again.	GnGjeLuG4EmjcYrhHlvP7Q	5	2014-12-26	0	1

This really impressed me as most companies want to see the job and try the up sell dance 1st before unloading a thing from their truck!

0	3Voow9MVv1D4WjEoQgMweA	3eq_FMJvhMH_JHqwke3vwg	This review is a long time over due. I have dealt with Jeremy in the past. When he told me he was sending one of his guys out to check an issue I was having , I was a little reluctant because I am picky about who works on my system. Dylan showed up promptly and even contacted us prior to him showing up. He sold me on 2 universal remotes for my living room and my theater. At first I thought it was a bit pricey but after the amazing job Dylan did I feel like I should have paid more. My system works better than it ever has and above any expectations I could have imagined. He was very concerned with my needs and asked many questions to make sure I got what I wanted. I'm sorry it took so long to leave a review but I was just using my remote thinking how simple everything has become and felt the need to leave this review. So thank you very much Dylan and Jeremy. Job well done and more.	GnGjeLuG4EmjcYrhHlvP7Q	5	2015-12-17	0	0

0	L6-_EsiHFy3a1K2kGOdm1g	PHuOc9WctKozsb-QRwLuqQ	Not sure where to start with these guys as they did seem very interested in installing a camera system in my home, their sales rep that came out even appeared very knowledgeable about their craft. A week later I followed up with them to see if they had come up with an estimate and was informed that they didn't have my contact information. When I finally did get the estimate it left off things we discussed and seemed a bit high, so I replied asking for clarification. Again a week went by with no reply until Jeremy contacted me to ask if I received their estimate, when I told him I had but had some questions and that I had replied to their original email asking for clarification. As we started to go over my questions I was informed that Chris was now out of town and Jeremy would have him contact me when he got back. Again a week went by with no contact until a third person called to follow up and see if I ever got the quote? I told the third person that I had and discussed it with Jeremy the prior week and I was still waiting to hear back from Chris, I was told he would follow up. As it turns out Chris did call a few minutes later but he didn't use my home number so his call went to voicemail. Never did talk with Chris but yet a fourth person called after another couple of days to follow up on the original quote. As I stated at the beginning they do appear very capable of doing a first rate job, but I will never know as their follow up to questions was basically nonexistent as their only real follow up was to ask for the job not answer any of my question and when we are looking at a $6,000 camera install, they could take a few minutes to answer questions. Reading all their reviews it does appear that I'm in the minority but I get the impression they really have very little internal communication or perhaps my job was just over their head, I'll really never know.

I was fortunate to remodel my home and could include them in the design of every room.  They were patient all throughout the process.  As with most all construction projects, change, change, change!  They stuck it through and were able to accommodate the entire way.  The prewire looked excellent.  They thought ahead and made sure wires could be pulled easily through the attic by hanging them rather than laying them on top of the beams ( I thought that was worth mentioning).  When we finally finished, they came to install all the fun stuff.  All the equipment was placed in a professional rack.  They even added LED's which gave it a nice touch! Most importantly, everything works like they advertised.  My lights are programmed for scenes and just need a push of a single button.  My automation system even reminds me to take out the trash. I'm living in the future thanks to Elite AV.	GnGjeLuG4EmjcYrhHlvP7Q	5	2017-07-14	0	0

We have 2 surround systems and several TVs that we have upgraded, added a sound bar outside and installed Rogu on all of them through out our home.  Dylan and his team also installed a complete system with a TV in each of the bedrooms and in the living area (7 total big screen tvs ) and all the bells and whistles at our Air B & B.  Everything works perfect and sounds outrageous.  I can't tell you how HAPPY WE ARE!!  IF YOU ARE IN NEED OF ANY AUDIO, VIDEO SYSTEM, OR INTERGRATION, DYLAN IS THE TECH YOU NEED TO CALL.  We have had service done by others and we always have had problems. They would come and fix a problem, and we would end up with a different problem because of it and each time it cost us a lot of money.  Not with Dylan and his team  THEY GET IT RIGHT THE FIRST TIME.  THEY REALLY KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING.  They actually give you a real phone number and are happy to answer any questions you may have.

I love home theater and was very particular about how I wanted everything laid out. They were very patient and worked with me on making sure they mounted and installed everything exactly the way I wanted.  My project required cutting and drilling in to my walls and they went too great lengths to protect all my furniture and equipment from the dust and debris while they worked. When they were done, they vacuumed up all the mess and made sure the furniture was carefully moved back.  They do good work, take pride in what they do, and are very reasonable when it comes to cost of labor. Definitely will use again or recommend to others.	GnGjeLuG4EmjcYrhHlvP7Q	5	2017-07-19	2	0

We needed an extra large TV mounted and were looking into having surround sound installed. They suggested a sound bar and booster instead of adding ceiling speakers which turned out to be more economical and it sounds incredible.

A special THANK YOU to Dylan - he stayed longer to get us signed up for and explain Roku, Pluto, etc. Since that day, I've texted Dylan with questions several times and he even called me at 8:00 at night to talk about an issue.

They made the entire process fun.  First, you can immediately tell that these guys know what they are doing - they've ""been there and done that.""  They are personable, professional and make you feel at ease - whether you buy gear from them or have your own, you can be assured that they will treat you the same and give you top notch advice on both integration and installation.  Although it's always best to get the gear from them and what they recommend, if you already have your own, they'll still work with you - which is different than MOST companies who will refuse your work altogether.  This is why Elite is so great.  My project was by far NOT the biggest because I'm a geek and like to do a lot myself, but they didn't shy away.  They did the work with a fervor and completed it with just as much energy and enthusiasm as if it was an entire house automation system with $250k worth of gear.  If you choose another company to do your work, you are making a mistake.  They did ZERO damage, nothing was amiss, the place was treated with respect and they were laughing and joking with me the entire time making me feel comfortable.  They quoted me to install my projector and screen, but even spent time terminating a few sub cables I had and did a quick calibration on the projector just to ensure the screen was ""OK.""  Who does that?  In Las Vegas, where everyone is out for the money, this is a company that is more interested in customer satisfaction and value.  I would work with them again in a heart beat.

1	dqKGX-Zz61Cz62S86mHNmg	Sq-66PV6yju_jrGyvcuRYA	I have been going to DT for over 5 years.For a dealership, I find they are pretty fair in the pricing and they do some extras, like wash your car for you.You can also have your scheduled maintenance (like oil changes/tire rotation) done on a Saturday - they are open until 4 pm.For those of us needing our cars during the week -- it works great.If you drop it off around noon - you can check out Dark Horse Coffee across the street, or Burger Shoppe, or Prohibition, also if you want Brunch there is Bonjour Brioche just up the street (great quiches and baguette!)Also, Toyota has a loyalty program now (no cost to enroll), and all your maintenance spend gets recorded, and you can use points towards service or other items.  The time before this time my Oil change was free.	RkPIetqaIc_lhNvGPImv9Q	3	2012-03-12	1	1

A couple years ago they left the window down and soaked the back seats when washing it. There was no apology or warning when I picked it up. I had to buy garbage bags to carry passengers the next couple days so they could sit on them. This past visit for regular maintenance I Was called because there were a few light bulbs out. I said I would do it myself and I found them changed anyway and the $38 added in at the end of my bill after pick up. I was going to do it myself because I already had spare ones in the storage and it takes 3 minutes or less. I'm becoming very skeptical about any dealership in this city!!!!

Has no one ever explained to these people that calls should be returned? I as well, have also caught them doing unnecessary work on my Camry. My new mechanic tells me it served me right going there!

0	kz4V3x5nAudeLjAgGm1Gpg	syxMa7g_giGzJqWly-fMRA	A few weeks ago received a letter from downtown toyota, saying that they're very interested in buying back my 2013 Prius c, I didn't think anything of it as I'm very happy with my car.  So a few days ago, I received a call from a Product Advisor: Lisa Tu, asking me if I was interested in selling my 2013 Prius c back to them, and that they can compensate me, and give me some kind of offer on a new car.I've never been asked for a buy back, so I thought what's the harm, I thought I go and see what they were going to offer me.  At first nothing was laid out clearly, but we slowly got to see what the numbers were, because all I wanted to see was the numbers, that's all I wanted.  Lisa stepped out and I talked to the manager (indian) directly,  we talked for a while,  still couldn't get a confirmation on what the set monthly payment will be, he wanted me to say yes before giving me the final offer, then he started to get very impatient with me, I felt very uncomfortable/pressured,  we ended the talk and that was that.Before going home, I went over to the service department to chat with an advisor, I had some thing I wanted to ask him, then Lisa came back and started giving me better offers, now that I have the numbers, I see what I was actually into,  but I decided the better option of me was to keep the car that I have, and continue driving it.   Throughout the whole process, Lisa stayed really patient and professional, but I kept saying no and they kept giving me better offers.At the end, I decided not to trade in for a new car, but Lisa still gave me a warm good bye, but another manager (caucasian) still trying to strike a deal, asking what would be a number I'm happy with, said he can tried to see if he can offer me a 90 days free of payment, I wasn't bluffing, I really was there to see what the offer was and decided I am better off with not trading my car, at the end he question me what I came the first place, which I did not appreciate.Overall, I highly recommend anyone looking for a toyota to talk to Product Advisor: Lisa Tu, but I would be very wary of the managers there, and do your research before going.  The indian manager told me toyota will still continue to offer the the prius c and prius v (wagon) for another two years, which I am not sure if he is just saying that to make a sale, or if it's confirmed.From my understanding, the prius c/v will most likely not get replaced, and only the standard prius, and maybe later a plug in prius will be added to the line up.

0	Duhy1-3YL7SOrThDh0vI7g	T9ZraFRugttlk-9efhRZyg	I'd give these guys negative stars if I could. I took my car in to get two engine sensors replaced, and after diagnosis, they handed me an estimate of approx $4000. That's the price of a new engine! I proceeded to tell them no, took my car to a mechanic that I know and trust (Heffner's Toyota in Kitchener) , and found out that this is a tactic that dealers use to get you to buy a new car. I wouldn't trust these guys to fix a lawnmower engine in the future. Be forewarned, this dealership is not to be trusted.	RkPIetqaIc_lhNvGPImv9Q	1	2014-11-30	6	0

My engine light has been on for a year. 3 visits (charged each time) they are still incapable of fixing it. Different excuse every time.  Pretty expensive even for an oil change. Long wait times even for the most straightforward repairs.  Not great at returning calls. There are better places unless you really want to get repairs at dealership. Not great service off warrantee.  I think I'll find somewhere else for service. Suggest you do too.	RkPIetqaIc_lhNvGPImv9Q	2	2014-04-23	4	0

A life sized Justin Bieber cut out (my 11 year old selfs secret fantasy), was strategically display in the front window of the Beauty Boutique along with his latest fragrance line to draw in any stray window shoppers ( of course I'm convincing myself it was really my subconscious wanting to escape the mere minus 30 weather outside) Walking in I certainly didn't expect to walk out with over $200 worth of cosmetics. Upon first entering I was greeted by a lovely tall, bubbly, blonde that not only looked but sounded like a Disney princess. She was quick to ask if I needed any help or if there was anything in particular I was looking for. When I assured her I was just ""browsing"" as us window shoppers do, she offered to give me a complimentary makeover. I have never been one to decline a little free pampering here and there so I quickly obliged making my self comfortable on a fancy black chair next to her. And so It began; a little Clarins Ever Matte foundation, followed by both Benefit blush in Coralista and Benefit They're Real mascara ( which might I add is probably the best mascara in the existence of mascaras), next was the Lise Watier lipstick in Evasion and to finish it off a spritz of Marc Jacobs new scent ""Dot"" ...vuala  she held up a mirror to show me her finished canvas and ten minutes later I was standing at the check out. The customer service was great, the product knowledge of the associate was excellent, the sales pitch was well played, the free samples were an added bonus...oh and my fancy new picture beside the Justin Bieber cutout left my 11 year old self jumping up and down on the inside. If you are looking to buy cosmetic this is the place to visit."	Pe3ga5SGKNIn5iSOy0XFEA	5	2012-12-28	1	1

0	eqWEgMH-DCP74i82BEAZzw	pWl_vlyglH-kse60JV66ng	This is the latest addition to feed my Shoppers Drug Mart addiction.  I strolled in laden down with groceries on the opening day, looking like a vagrant, but was treated like a red carpet worthy customer.  I was served by Maxine, the beauty manager, and she was simply lovely.  Very sweet, knowledgeable, sense of humour and not at all pushy.  I walked out happier than when i walked in and it was purely based on service received; not the cut price package of Pirate cookies that made it into my basket.The store itself is medium sized but seems to pack pretty much everything in.  You have to scoot by the Beauty Boutique to get to the main part which is pretty sneaky.  It's so hard to resist all those shiny, colourful (and expensive) things.  It's a well stocked Beauty Boutique too with the usual Lancome, Clarins, Elizabeth Arden etc as well as Lise Watier, Benefit etc.   The rest of the store is sparkling (well, it is new) and full of the usual mixture of a few groceries, medications, cosmetics etc.  Staff were genuinely pleasant and everybody seemed happy to be there.This one is  a keeper.  I'll definitely be adding it to my list of places to spend money!	Pe3ga5SGKNIn5iSOy0XFEA	4	2011-10-09	0	0

I skipped the offer.During my military exit physical four years later four  fillings were offered. I accepted two, skipped two and had no more cavities/fillings for a decade.A California reconstructive dentist building a crown for me rained me with a shower of things I MUST do NOW.  None inexpensive.Dr. Vogel has been balanced regarding my dentistry. His staff have kept my teeth clean and healthy 12+ years.

We took off from the Scottsdale Air-park with our friends in the Desert Splash Adventures Cessna Caravan Sea Plane. The plane holds 9. For the next hour and a half, we flew through all of the canyons along the ""Apache Air Trail"" as the pilot called it.  The pilot, Carl, is a 3rd generation pilot from Alaska and does a great job providing the history of the area along with some humor.  You get to see all of the bridges and dams along the way. The best part of the trip for me was the water landing on Lake Roosevelt.  Never done that before! After takeoff we then flew past ancient Indian cliff ruins, Weaver's Needle and the Superstitions before returning to Scottsdale.  What a fun time.  I maxed out the memory card in my camera but plan to do this again. They have powered kayaks you can use on Roosevelt that I want to try on the next trip."	J3o5LSrcuqbUl3K3_RxjYA	5	2012-01-19	2	1

The Apache Trail Tour starts at Scottsdale airport and flies you all over the Valley. Pilot Rob really knows his stuff and is a great narrator when it comes to the history of the area and what you're seeing out of your windows.Splash landing!! But not bouncy. The touchdown on Roosevelt Lake was so smooth I actually couldn't tell when we landed on the water. After taxiing to the shore we were able to get out and explore for a while. The total time was two hours. This is a great tour for all ages. The kids had a blast and we had four generations on our plane. Everybody loved it! They do private parties and brunches on the lake as well. We will definitely be back!	J3o5LSrcuqbUl3K3_RxjYA	5	2015-12-25	0	0

I'm a private pilot and I've flown through the Superstition mountains a few times(though I never landed on the water) so it kind of didn't seem all that exciting to me.  Boy was I wrong!
