I had the chicken chimichanga and my friend had of the chicken burrito supreme. I will never visit Robertos, Pepe's tacos, etc. again. #obsessed	OQcvO5P3gH0cuJ-bPXwfQQ	5	2017-07-16	1	0

Walking inside I was greeted by a sweet young girl who also took my order and she was nice about going over the menu and what the specials included. Inside was clean and decorated nicer than I expected. There was also a good amount of customers eating inside which I took as a good sign. I noticed they had different daily specials on the windows out front and they are totally worth checking out. I was here on a Friday and the special that day is 2 enchiladas, beans, rice and a drink all for $5.95 before tax. Great deal! The rice was lacking a bit on flavor and while the beans could have used more cheese, they did taste good and I liked the few tortilla chips on top of them. The enchiladas had a decent amount of cheese inside and the sauce tasted good. I'd for sure come back for this special again.Al Pastor Taco ($1.75) - The tacos come meat, onion and cilantro. There's a salsa bar with veggies and containers. I grabbed some of the red and green sauce and favored the green. My taco was filled nicely and had great flavor. Carne Asada Burrito ($5.99) - Here's where things got odd for me. Hubby and I intended to share this and he always prefers just meat, cheese and sour cream in his burritos. The girl who took our order said he couldn't have it that way and that the burrito had to have beans and rice inside. If the burritos aren't pre-made this shouldn't be a hard request at all. I saw a different girl putting meat on the grill and then put the burrito together, so I can't figure out why the burrito couldn't be customized to have the rice and beans left off. The burrito was a nice size for the price and did taste good, but it would have been better enjoyable if it could have been made the way preferred. Great weekly deals and decent Mexican food. I'd come back.	OQcvO5P3gH0cuJ-bPXwfQQ	4	2017-06-20	66	67

I've been to this restaurant probably 10 to 15 times and have never had a bad meal. Is the owner and staff of this restaurant are very nice and courteous and provide a good service and excellent food. I highly recommend this place for anything Mexican on their menu you will not be disappointed.	OQcvO5P3gH0cuJ-bPXwfQQ	5	2016-06-12	1	1

Reminded me a little of Texas, in terms of quality. Enchilada was very tasty, great sauce. Rice and beans were both delicious. Chile Relleno needed a tiny bit more flavor, but had plenty of cheese. Great little salsa bar. Had a bite of gf's Huevos Rancheros and we agreed that they were pretty awesome. We'll be back soon.	OQcvO5P3gH0cuJ-bPXwfQQ	4	2015-08-01	4	2

I haven't got my food yet, but the smell coming out the kitchen is amazing. It's a Friday night in Vegas, at a hole in the wall taco shop. The single file line is out the door.....Now that's a recipe for GREAT Mexican food	OQcvO5P3gH0cuJ-bPXwfQQ	5	2017-03-11	0	0

Just might have to give up my usual taco spot!!!! Food was great. My only critic no chips and salsa before the meal and only gives you a couple chips stuck in the great beans!!! Also might look into making up paper menus. Nothing to take home to read. The service impeccable. Will be back for sure.	OQcvO5P3gH0cuJ-bPXwfQQ	5	2015-07-22	1	0

I was craving authentic tacos, as i reminisced on my favorite taco shop in san francisco.      First stop was Cardenas. It was closer to me but the lines were ridiculous and the environment chaotic. Needless to say, i left in search of greener pastures. Second stop, the las vegas chain Rigos tacos. The place gave me a creepy vibe plus their soda machine was not working. I'm all for hole in the wall places but this place was too much.     As I drove aimlessly i came across this place, Mi pueblo Taco shop. Boy was I pleasantly surprised!! my  long search of a mom & pop taco shop proved fruitful. The lady at the counter and the cook turned out to be husband and wife, and the owners. They were both extremely friendly  and the food was delicious!! they had weird pricing quirks but hopefully they figure it out. overall, 5 stars and will definitely come back again.

1	cQzo2WX1TyPEmS5jPzOUoA	sG2U7rH5NSTYR3-DumVT7w	TLDR: Lunch Specials; salsa bar available; excellent service; subpar food; convenience charge for card paymentI was really craving excellent chips and salsa so I usually have a go-to spot for Mexican fare. Learning that they were closed, I found something in the area with excellent reviews and was happy to find this location with a Yelp check-in.  I skimmed the reviews and saw several 4/5 star reviews with a couple of 2 star reviews so I decided to give this place a shot. Service was excellent and I was impressed with the politeness and grammar used in both English and Spanish upon walking in and ordering. It reflected that the business cares about the customer and how they are perceived when spoken to by the various clientele. I immediately placed an order for the chips and beans and was happy to see breakfast items on a menu. My foodie friend ordered a pastor burrito and I ordered chilaquiles with green sauce. Unfortunately, this is where I should've listened to the 2-star reviews. While I believe that the food is made fresh in-house, the quality lacks and pales in comparison to the service. The beans lacked flavor, excluding the cotija cheese and the chips were stale. This is probably a storage issue. The salsa were flavorful, but lacked spice. Interestingly enough, the green salsa was the spiciest. My friends pastor burrito was just ok. Not fantastic, not terrible. Just ok. It probably is similar to Roberto's, my terrible baseline for Mexican food flavor and service. My chilaquiles were tragic. The rice was pretty bad and the green sauce was pretty boring. It's sad to say that Del Taco has better rice, beans, and green sauce. Needless to say, I didn't enjoy the dish and I won't return anytime soon.	OQcvO5P3gH0cuJ-bPXwfQQ	2	2017-07-15	2	0

0	d9y5MjVOgxcP4Zc7qjowdA	PM5aFLiwbKWDm_AtC71-3Q	I walked in my scrubs and the owner asked me how I found out about his place.  I told him Yelp and that I was in the area for a school assignment and lived across town.  He never heard of Yelp and didnt know that his place has a 5 star rating.  He was wearing an SD cap and I found out he lived in San Diego.  If you ever had authentic San Diego Mexican food you know this place is legit, because it reminded me of that.  I found this to be a unique experience with genuinely nice restaurant owners not catering to Yelp reviewers.  Hopefully that won't change after my random stop there.I had a carnitas burrito, cachete taco and carne asada taco, and a horchata (no not Smart Chata).  Overall the carne asada was the most flavorful with a nice charred taste.  The cachete was tasty.  My carnitas burrito was good too, similar to the SD burritos I miss.  Tortilla, meat, rice, beans, and since I'm originally from San Francisco I added some sour cream with guacamole.  The salsa was also fresh and tasty.	OQcvO5P3gH0cuJ-bPXwfQQ	5	2016-11-03	3	3

Everything I had was simply delicious and would go out of my way to venture in this neighborhood for Tacos and Mexican foodThe cashier/server was very friendly and asked if it was my first time here. She answered my questions and made me feel welcomed. I originally was going to order Tacos only but the enchilada combo grab my attention and got the combo with a single order of Carne Asada Taco on the side because I had to get a taco too. When the order finally arrived at my table. I got the three different salsas that was available at the salsa bar. From the first bite of my taco and enchiladas 1-beef & 2-chicken combination along with the fresh salsas. Every bite was amazingly flavorful and authentic. The whole experience was great and felt like I was taking a short vacation in Mexico!	OQcvO5P3gH0cuJ-bPXwfQQ	5	2016-07-05	4	2

I have had every single meal available here, and I NEVER once had anything that was bland or stale. They Cook everything fresh, despite what others think. Even though I'm guessing those people have never seen the cooks in action. This place is 1 IN A MILLION! I've been going since they've opened in 2008. I have never regretted going there. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PLACE AND THE OWNERS! It's such a shame when people check in on here to get free food and THEN POST NEGATIVE REVIEWS ABOUT THE FOOD THAT THEY ACTUALLY HAVE TO PAY FOR LOL.

The complimentary chips and beans I got for my Yelp check-in were excellent. I upgraded to a larger size beans in order to share. You can tell these beans are the real thing.... slow cooked with love for the flavor and not smashed too much. Yum.My husband has the carne asada burrito, it was huge, their version came with rice and beans inside the burrito, a little different than other taco shops I have been to.I had the combination plate, Chicken Enchilada, Chiles Relleno, and Chicken Taco. This plate came with rice and beans. Everything was excellent, but the star of the show was the taco!My next visit I will definitely try some of the other tacos on the menu. The salsas in the salsa bar were amazing, I put it on everything!So here is the bad news about this place........ the neighborhood! This shopping center and parking lot is scary! There are so many people loitering in front of the next door liquor store. I am glad I was with my husband, I really would not have felt safe coming here without him and coming here after dark.......

Stepping into this place, it's an enigma wrapped in an enigma. Sholay isn't heavily advertised in your face so you don't know what to expect. The restaurant name brings memories of the legendary movie and elite characters. Come on. Don't tell me you can't hear Amjad Khan's voice :) Enough of me being Basanti . The place has: a large poster of Shah Rukh Khan, a pic of the Dalai Lama , and generic scenery pics. As you walk in you are promptly greeted by two American white people. The instinct as a desi is to run away but please resist this urge. You find out the staff, are owners and chefs who love desi food. The """"white dude"""" who is their head chef, couldn't be more """"desi"""" when it comes to spices and food. Loved the chicken wings and chicken kabob here.

There are three or four Indian curries on the menu. We got the chicken curry. The guy (there was only one person there, to cook and work the counter, but they weren't busy, so hey) said it was really good. If you're desi, you know what shan and all the boxed masalas taste like, and this definitely had that taste. Not saying it's a bad thing, but fresh masalas give a curry an aroma that this lacked. The chicken shish kabob was bland, except for the red chili powder added liberally on top, and it wasn't actual shish kabob. The best thing I had was the lamb burger. Oh my gosh. The lamb was super juicy. And the fries already had black pepper. Loved it. The place is super duper clean. Even the bathroom. Like I said, there was one person to cook, serve, answer calls, and take orders. He told us the others were out for a catering. This is in no way true Indian food. The shish kabobs aren't Indian shish kabobs, but rather Middle Eastern kabobs, the naan isn't true naan, either. Don't go to this place expecting awesome Indian food. But it is a decent place to go for a burger or the pizza."""	bzUSbd9YLoK3egnTkXFd1Q	3	2014-05-06	1	0

My only complaint (almost 20 minutes for one to-go order with only 2 or 3 other customers at the time) was the waiting, but the employees were nice and made sure to let me know that I wasn't forgotten.  The shish kabobs were tender and savory, and their balsamic vinaigrette for my salad was the best I've ever had!!!  The saffron rice was also delicious even though it appeared to be the item that was delaying my order.   I should've called ahead, but next time, I want to try their lamb burgers...  Limited menu but top quality ingredients, yummm!3/12/14I returned there after work to pick up my lamb burger and side salad to go.  The ground lamb meat was indeed tasty, but I was disappointed by the smallish size compared to the bun.  I'll stick with the kabobs and rice in the future.  I was told by the nice man behind the counter that they'll be expanding the Indian portion of the menu in a few months so here's hoping they add samosas!	bzUSbd9YLoK3egnTkXFd1Q	4	2014-03-07	0	0

The basmati rice was also spiced in a subtle way that complemented the meat.  He brought me a sample of the rice pudding, and it was very good, along with the mango yogurt smoothie, which would be a refreshing drink come the hot days of summer.

I had heard about it through yelp but didn't expect to try it out anytime soon. I was taken back by the fact that the owner of the place was not Indian! He was VERY friendly though and so I give this place a 5 for customer service! After having asked if the meat was halal, the owner told us that everything was halal except for the beef pepperoni. I'm very grateful that he not only verbally stated it, but has it written down on the menu as well. We weren't really starving so we placed an order for halal wings & fries as well as the pizza naan (with chicken, cheese and pizza sauce). He asked us if we wanted him to make it spicy, and like most Indians and Pakistanis, OF COURSE we said yes. So he made added chillies as well. Fast forward to the food - the halal wings were GREAT. Spicy, but a little too breaded. My bf noticed this as well, and was the first one to point it out. The fries came out extremely salty, but I finished the majority of them anyways. The pizza naan was good! Especially if you like chicken keema! The chillies the owner added made it spicy and quite scrumptious. The best part of our trip to this place was definitely the MANGO LASSI. The owner gave us each a sample which led us to ordering one. The lassi was thick, unlike many other places you order a lassi, and you could taste the yogurt. YUM. The owner also gave us a sample of the rice pudding, but I wasn't that big of a fan. I'm not the biggest sugar addict but I just wasn't feeling it. I hope to come back for the lamb burger and the lassi next time! Overall, this isn't entirely """"Sholay"""". If you are looking for Indian (as in""""desi khana"""") food, go elsewhere. If you are looking for American styled Indian food, this is your place."""	bzUSbd9YLoK3egnTkXFd1Q	3	2014-04-02	1	0
0	bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw	2ri42IvMGvPDKZCVBhJmCQ	First impression is that this place is very clean but a little confusing- you walk in and see a buffet-type set up, but it's not being utilized and looks like there's a lot of junk around the kitchen area. I was immediately greeted and handed a menu, which has American breakfast specialties on the front, and inside is a small kabob selection, naan pizzas, and burgers. Very odd combination of offerings.Ordered the chicken kabob platter to go, and was offered a breaded chicken wing to sample while I waited- they are trying out new menu items. The wing was huge and mostly composed of breading, which is not what I'm looking for at all when I'm ordering wings. Flavor was okay, but the wing itself was just weird.Got home with my food in a reasonable amount of time and it was nice and hot- the kabobs were delicious, and my BF snagged a few bites even after devouring his sandwich. The rice in particular was very good: I'm not one to rave about rice, but it was moist and flavorful, and had some white, some yellow, and some orange in it- likely a combination of white and saffron rice, with additional seasonings. The naan and salad were also fresh, and the portion was generous, and on par with the $10 total. Best part of the meal was the cilantro sauce for the kabobs- it was killer. Highly recommend, get it on anything.	bzUSbd9YLoK3egnTkXFd1Q	2	2014-03-02	3	0

Everyone who wants to try them without going to the Midwest/East coast can now have a taste of the well known slider. I have enjoyed White Castle before in Chicago and found that they are quite tasty and I can put a few back. My cousin always orders them with extra pickles.  I should have remembered that when eating them in Vegas.  I forgot that tidbit, but they were still really good. I really wish they had a location in Denver.  That would make my year.  The best 2 things about the one on the strip, they are open 24 hours and they sell beer.  What can make this place better? Well, it is also attached to a casino! The place was hoping and cranking out burgers at a rapid rate.  If you haven't tried White Castle, now is your time.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	5	2015-05-28	0	0

It's a reason people in Saint Louis call them sliders. Lol Yes my husband is from Saint Louis so I have a degree in the fine art of White Castle. You order these when their is a long line. You sit and eat them. I enjoy them most when I have been dancing all night and the club is closed and it's 3am. And all my friends meet up to have these. Omg the fries are great with cheese.

1	D3GeQgpvMLwZCCHHdvyqaA	9VlUxstf22VBfFPIcZM6eg	"""Very small restaurant capitalizing off the brand's nostalgia and charm. They sell their signature miniature """"slider"""" sized burgers at an overpriced rate. This seems to be the selling gimmick for White Castle, luring in drunk gamblers or curious tourists to stop in. The restaurant itself is attached to the casino of the Venetian I believe. It is located on the Strip, with a one door entry point. A long line of hungry customers fills the restaurant, although it moves rather quickly. There are only 5-6 tables, with 2 larger bar-stool type tables for seating. As you reach closer to the register, you are welcomed with a better view to the behind-the-scenes look of White Castle. Rapid hands swiftly assemble buns amongst grilled onions and juicy meat patties, exchanging between different work stations to finally end up placed in a singular order, ready for the customer. A large glass window display showcases some of the White Castle souvenirs that are available to purchase to take home. A $10 coffee cup or a $25 T-shirt? Not for me but maybe for others. Last, but certainly not least, was the food. If you're familiar with the case and recognition of White Castle, then eating at the actual location only provides a slightly more fresh experience than the frozen, store-bought burgers. The buns are much softer and are squishy to the touch. The taste and aroma of the grilled onions complement the meat patty. It's White Castle, there isn't much too glorify about it or expect. My experience was pleasant, but to each their own. For $8.99 you can get 4 Cheese Sliders, a small fry and a small drink. The price is consistent with the glamorization of the branding. I ate each slider in about 2 bites and was still hungry afterwards, but didn't want to face waiting in a long line again.

That thing they do with the onions is over the top.  Not as good a burger as I remember as a kid but maybe I have eaten too many celebrity chef burgers and acquired a different taste.  Hard to park to get there but if you're in the neighborhood pick up a few and enjoy.  Fast and friendly service and smells great.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	4	2017-05-11	0	0
3	X1Cy1xsDawDiH0o9dmDIXA	7j_gZ0Q_itkSL2gLS1SrQg	Ok so I'm not from the east coast so I've tried many burgers in Vegas and I was pretty disappointed with these. Food: Cheese sliders- 2/5 I ordered the cheese sliders. The burgers were small and pricey. I didn't like the smell of them and I didn't like how it tasted like a burger from any other franchised restaurant. Nothing stood out for me. Chicken rings- 1/5 Seriously don't get these. They are crispy but flavorless and super thin. Honestly thought McDonalds chicken nuggets were better. French fries- 2/5 Fries were a bit soggy. But these were my favorite out of all the stuff I ordered. Service is GOOD! 4/5:Expect a long wait. I waited in line for more than an hour but I got my food in less than 5 mins! They are friendly and efficient!! They try to make the wait bearable by talking to you, which I thought was neat. Overall if your a person who likes a burger with flavor and who has ate many flavorful burgers, White Castle isn't for you.

Unless someone can convince me that there is a must try item on their menu. I'll stick to regular in n out. Service here was horrible. The one thing that did bug me was when our order was called.

0	MbEV-LcSKSGcIevJJXw1zg	zLA_57ge8X1oUXY2rEUHzQ	This place is literally the worst place I have ever been. (Service-wise). The food is relatively standard-ware. I came and waited in line with 3 of my friends on an afternoon, and waited about 20 minutes in line to place my order. I understand that places get busy, so it was acceptable.However, after about 30 minutes of waiting for our orders, my friends all got their orders, but I still had not yet received mine. I inquired several times about my order, and where it was in the queue. My friends finished eating, and we kept waiting around.Each time I asked, the person handing out the food would promptly dismiss me, and even the manager bluntly and rudely told me they serve hundreds of burgers a day, and it would come out soon enough. Also note - my order number was 374, but they kept on calling order 274 out. I asked if they perhaps had my order ready, but they told me no, they had Order 274 ready, and that it was not my order.Now, about 1.5 hours after entering the restaurant, and an hour after placing my order, I demanded that they finally look inside the bag, and the manager who had been extremely rude finally conceded that they had mislabeled my order.Instead of offering anything to help make it better, they only offered me a brownie, which means that they valued wasting about an extra hour of my time at ~2 dollars.If they had merely checked the queue the first time I asked, no problems would have occurred, and we could have resolved all the issues. Instead, this Whitecastle decides to run as if the customer is always wrong, and will stonewall and lie to you about your order.Once a mistake is also made, they will make a measly effort to fix their problems.I strongly recommend you go elsewhere for a burger fix in Vegas.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	1	2016-06-21	3	0

The bun is super soft but delicious. The combination of cheap and small makes you want to come back for more. Unfortunately you will need to order quite a few in order to feel full. Sometimes simple is better. There is no glamour to these burgers. The restaurant is full of people with happy smiles.

And I saw a few order the 100 burger box...I actually couldn't help myself but stare several times...I felt instant guilt and wondered how many children in the Philippines were hungryI liked the burgers but after seeing what can't be unseen...I won't be going back and I'll be heading to church to pray and to the gym to run	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	4	2015-02-08	1	0

I am sure people love it when they are drunk as well but I was sober when I ate these!  The ones at the market do not have pickles in them but these do.  The taste so good with the cheese!!  Their fries are pretty good too as well as their fried onion things.  Kinda like onion rings.  I would definitely come back!  Too bad they don't sell it in singles.NOTE:-Extra charge for cheese (30 cents each)	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	4	2016-11-22	6	6

I literally went on a journey from Reno to Las Vegas, then finally got to White Castle with high hopes.Yea there was a long line (its Vegas, there are long lines everywhere and long wait times in Vegas on the strip).We got our food quickly, but oh my gawd it was disgusting.  I am so disappointed that the burgers were watery, like they were frozen and not cooked all the way.The sliders filled me up quickly, but it was not satisfying. Definitely really expensive and not worth the price. Dont expect to have that amazing experience there, unless you are super drunk or high and dont care what you put in your mouth. Fries were ok.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	2	2017-06-01	1	0

Harold and Kumar promoted this place like no other so everyone had to come try them, I was one of those people.The sliders are worse than the ones sold in the frozen foods section. It is small and will fit into the size of your palm. The bread was slightly warm and soggy. The patty was dry. The small pickle was lying naked alongside small speckles of onions. It was not tasty at all. I had to squeeze a full bag of ketchup on it to give it life. For a dollar something each, I would rather walk myself to a McDonalds and order something off the dollar menu.My boyfriend and I decided to come here because it was 5am and he was starving. Shake Shack and Rasising Canes were both closed so White Castle it was. The next morning, my boyfriend and I woke up with bad tummyaches. Luckily, our hotel had two bathrooms....	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	1	2015-06-18	2	2

Friends say that they were once plentiful, but I understand that they have retreated to the comfort of the east coast. Save this one. This White Castle is all alone out here in Vegas. So, it was on my list of things to see and experience in Las Vegas. I'd never had one. Not even from the grocery store. I'd even seen all three of the Harold & Kumar movies about them. I was super excited. Well done White Castle!      So, I parked my ride back at the LINQ self parking, and hiked down this way to get to the Treasure Island for the Pirate ship battles and the Marvel thingy. It was quite of a hike to thie point. Several times I pondered giving up and taking the Monorail. But I persevered, and this was a well deserved stopping point. The Las Vegas strip is deceptively long.       As I entered there was a bit of a line at the counter when I walked in. The sounds of the nearby casino jingled and buzzed and tempted through a huge opening in one wall. I assume the White Castle is open at all hours to collect the hungry gamblers. Which is probably alot, as the smell of burgers wafted across my nose as I looked up at the great big menu to figure out what I wanted. Looking at the items, the prices ranged within your usual 'fast food prices'.     There was a range of options. Meat, other Meat. Fake Meat. No Meat. All the glutens, none of the glutens. Even Vegetarian and probably Vegan options. I saw a sign for a double cheeseburger combo (little teeny ones) and decided that's what I wanted. I wound my way through the line and got to a register, and ordered one from the nice lady behind the counter.    I was given a cup and a receipt. I took both to find a place to sit. Easier said than done. This place was pretty popular. Eventually I found one at a high common table. I set my camera bag and phone on the table corner to mark it as being taken. As I went over to get an iced tea, I heard my number called. I altered my trip back to my table, and veered back over towards the counter to pick up my tray of food. I was excited, I was eager. I was going to try White Castle burgers. I reached into my bag and withdrew the three small boxes inside.     Hrm. These three tiny things are supposed to fill up me? Seriously? Hrm. Ok. After the yelp photo, I carefully pulled out the miniscule burgers, doing my best to save the buns from ripping. I excitedly took a bite of one. It was okay? I was not as awed and amazed as Harold and Kumar were. I wasn't overwhelmed and taken away on a meaty dream sequence of awesomeness. I was just kinda sorta whelmed.    Even the iced tea was that fountain done stuff. Not brewed iced tea. Meh. I'd have rather been eating a Carl's Jr. Big Carl. But. I'd finally experienced it. Checked it off my list. That's part of the excitement of life I suppose. To get out there and try new things. Sometimes they're just not as great as the commercials.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	3	2017-01-13	2	1

This is a """"only choice"""" type of eat. Don't eat here if you have other options.

0	idtBBgts7weFgfoJLyBb3Q	FtO1FykFid19U03zPxbobg	I expected better from here. The sliders weren't that tasty and became a chore to eat after a while. The chicken rings tasted like frozen dino nuggets (not even as good as Dino nuggets). I also had the vanilla milkshake, which was pretty good. It tasted like an In N Out shake, but sweeter. The fries weren't that bad either, I would eat them again. Lastly, the onion chips were probably the best out of the whole meal; they were really crispy and delicious. Overall, I wouldn't come back here by choice but it wasn't a HORRIBLE experience. Their staff was friendly and service was quick, impressive since it's pretty full..being on the strip and all. All and all, i say come and try it out for yourself. It just didn't meet my expectations.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	2	2016-11-25	0	0

They were selling milkshakes and didn't even have them ready me and several other people had to wait a little too long for the rude manager. The lady screaming out the orders was very unorganized and rude. They need a better way of putting the food out when it's ready. And the worst part was when I get home I find out that one of the bags was burnt, it was like somebody left it next to a warmer and was like oops let me just put the bag where they can't see it. Really? You are gonna sell burnt burgers and bags? The only positive thing was I did get my 30 burgers quickly and before other people, even though it was BURNT!! Seriously I never had so many problems in one place.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	1	2015-02-01	6	0

For a family of 3, it was me, my wife & our 3 year old, i ordered the 4 cheeseburger sliders combo and extra 2 cheeseburger slider. I thought it was enough for us, but I had to order a few more lol.  For me its best to eatitwhen it is still warm, everything just melts in ur mouth, and im craving for it right now again while writing this review.I ordered a $5 chocolate shake too and that was also good!  Their service is really fast and food quality is great, that is why for me, they deserve a 5-star rating.  At the time that we were there, there was a good amount of people.  When I paid for my food they gave me a number, i went to go get my drink, a minute or two after, they called my number right away, so i was very satisfied.Its a small dining area, so It might be a little hard for you if you come here when there is a lot of people.When I come back to Vegas, I would definitely come back here.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	5	2015-10-14	0	0
1	23cjtl3AWJtxKL3O78-Djw	AGilPZcTb1pdxgZ1abLmMg	11 years! That's how long it has been since Harold and Kumar made such a fuss about these tiny burgers, and how long I have been waiting to find out if it was worth it.  Spoiler: It kind of is.The meat is really nothing special here.  It looks preformed from frozen (I could be wrong, but just my observation) and it very thin.  What makes this joint stand out is everything else in addition to the location.  The burgers grill on a flat top coated with onions to soak in flavor.  They are simply made with a couple leftover onions and a pickle, plus cheese if you pay extra.  No frills needed, or really requested for that matter.  The other options I tried were pretty basic type fast food, so nothing special I would go back for.This location is 24/7 right on the Vegas strip and whether it was noon after a night of drinking, or 4am during a night of drinking - this place is gold! 4 bite burgers that are pretty cheap, freshly made in front of you and aren't super heavy.  I chowed down on 5 of them easily feeling satisfied without feeling sick the next day or really even feeling regret from eating anything overly greasy or poor quality.In a regular fast food setting it would be just that to me.  A quick bite when I don't really care about what I'm eating the way most fast food is.  On the Vegas strip however, this is probably my new favorite stop during the night or before I get some sleep!	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	4	2015-09-11	0	0

Makes me wonder if I'm ingesting beef or any kind of real meat for that matter. I'm not a big girl, but I swear I could have killed like 20 burgers (eh hem, really they're SLIDERS) if our group didn't already have reservations for Gordon Ramsay's steakhouse. I was there for Superbowl and this location had just opened so the wait was pretty ridiculous over the weekend but we waited in line in the late afternoon so our wait wasn't as bad.

We parked at the Venetian and walked outside by where Sephora was at and its tucked in a little casino. But you will be able to see the White Castle sign. When we got there the lines were not as busy like we hoped it would be. It took me a long time to come just because the hype made it impossible to come. Thank god we waited though.We ordered 20 like cheeseburgers sliders. They also has beer for you beer drinkers. They are like I expected little tiny cheeseburgers with 1 pickle Alice and some onions. For some reason it did taste good. But it taste like how the frozen one would taste at a grocery store. Although those sliders were tiny I did get start to get full off 3. I probably won't be returning here unless one of my tourist family members want to try it out. It wasn't a horrible experience I just feel like there's nothing special about White Castle.

Seriously.  What in the world did you expect?  As far as taste goes, White Castle is not for some.  I can't hate on people not liking it if it's their first time.  I'm also well aware there are FAR more better burgers available, but sometimes you just want a White Castle that is cooked unlike any other burger.  The burger tasted like I expected, and the cashier, who I'm sure wanted to rip her own head off, was a sweetheart.  Being the lines were so crazy, I asked her if anybody in her team had walked out yet, and she said """"we're soldiers!"""".  I loved her attitude, and I wish I had remembered her name.  My gripe, and why it's 3 stars, is with their pricing.  I know it's a strip joint, but there are other chains that charge their regular prices on the strip.  A few steps down is a Chipotle and a McDonald's that charges the same as any other one of their locations.  I don't care that rents are higher on the strip and it's their only location.  Whenever they come into town...locals CRAM THEIR FOOD TRUCKS for their burgers.  They could have just as easily chosen an off-strip location and made a killing off of us.  I split a Crave Pack that came with 10 hamburgers (we paid extra for cheese), 20 chicken rings, and 2 regular fries.  Large sodas ($2.99) were separate.  The bill came out to $38.88.  I'm sorry, but $19.50 for 5 cheeseburgers, 10 chicken rings, fries, and a soda is lame.  For $20, I can come up with 50 other places I rather eat at.  Also, they offer a combo that comes with 3 cheeseburgers and regular fries for 8.77...WITHOUT A SODA.  That's just wrong considering fountain soda usually has the highest markup of any of their items.  They could've easily included the soda.  I won't be going back, but I'm hoping that they'll open up some off-strip locations and possibly offer the pricing that other White Castles are used to offering...because at the end of the day...this is White Castle, not Five Guys (or any other burger joint of your choice)."""	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	3	2015-01-29	21	4

It's located at a smaller casino called Casino Royale which is sandwiched between the Venetian and Harrahs.

On the other hand, you're better off getting something else.The sliders were alright. Ended up getting the 20-pack with two fries. Add cheese to them and it's a little extra. Also ordered some mozzarella sticks. Total came to just under $40. If you buy the slider packs, it would be cheaper than buying 2 or 3 meals that come with maybe 3 sliders and a drink and fries. Up to you what you wanna do.It's good to try. But I'm probably going to skip this and find another 24-hour place for something quick.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	2	2016-07-11	0	0

They do not taste like any other burgers you may have eaten. They are 'steam' grilled and this gives them a unique flavor and texture. If you go to White Castle with any kind of preconceived notions of what a burger is supposed to taste like, you will be disappointed. This is where the negative reviews come from; people who are going to White Castle for the first time who are expecting something different. All I can tell these people is that, unless you've grown up with White Castle burgers, they are an acquired taste. They are the caviar of fast food burgers.You may not like White Castle burgers the first time you try them. But, after you eat them few times, you'll wake up at 3 a.m. some night and find yourself craving them. Those of us who grew up with them understand this. As I said, White Castle burgers give you the munchies without smoking pot.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	5	2015-02-05	0	1

The sliders are little bites of heaven which do a great job coating your alcohol laden belly. Being originally from Detroit there was a White Castle on every corner so it wasn't an urgent run to try them when they arrived on the Strip. Being drunk and at Harrah's seeing the White Castle was like a beacon calling us over. The place was packed as we weren't the only ones with the same brilliant idea. The cashiers do a pretty efficient job filling all the orders as quick as possible so expect to wait 15 minutes on a busy weekend night. 4 cheeseburgers, fries, and a pop (dammit I'm from Michigan and it's POP not soda) will set you back $8.99 but the extra space it soaks up for more alcohol consumption is priceless.

It was nothing to get excited about but these are pretty good sliders. The staff is amazing about getting everyone through the line and the food comes out quick. So mad props to the employees and their good service. I give it three stars because it just isn't a big deal. Be sure to order double what you think you can eat. Otherwise you'll be hungry.

Or if you had ''too much fun'' at the clubs.Location:This burger hot spot is located near the Linq, across from Mirage-- it's literally next to """"Margaritaville'' or whatever. But definitely easy to spot (look for the castle structure sign).Interior:This is a typical fast food joint. Need I say more?Food:The burgers were pretty small. Being a Hefty Hannah that I am (inside and out), 5 burgers & fries would probably fill me up. I kid you not, I could probably fit 2-3 burgers in the palm of my hand. Compared to Shake Shack & In n Out -- this place is.... different. If you're into small & soft burgers-- this is the place for you. Also, I really like how the cheese is always melted in the burger (that's total perfection). However, the squiggly fries were """"eh."""" Same with the chicken rings-- I could pass on both and stick with the CHEESEBURGERS. Oh, and be sure to ask for the sauces with your burgers-- it definitely makes for an exciting twist. Between the other burger spots, I would choose this place because it's one of those, hashtag cheap eats -- and bragging rights of """"OMG, I ate 10 burgers!""""Service: It was alright. Nothing to complain about.TLDR:This place is great for cheap burgers-- comparable to McDonalds, but better. in flavor and MELTED CHEESE! Burgers are small, so order A LOT (5-6 per person).Turn Ons:- Cheap- Melted cheese- Super small KAWAIIIII burgers- Sauces- Opens 24/7 (I think...).Turn Offs:- Fries & Chicken rings (ew)"""	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	4	2016-04-21	4	4

Being from California my heart belongs to in n out. That being said, their sliders are pretty good for the price. The sliders are on a soft pillowy bun with grilled onions and pickles with the option of cheese.We received a text 3 days before the official opening date stating that White Castle was giving away free food. Within minutes we were out the door and made the 20 minute drive to the strip.When we got there, there was caution tape preventing us to enter the restaurant from the casino, but we were able to see the entire restaurant. We saw kitchen staff making sliders and contractors making finishing touches. We figured that they would give away all the sliders they were practicing to make for the grand opening. After being told that they were only giving them to casino employees we decided to hang out for 45 minutes hoping for the chance they would have extra for us. We even offer to pay for them.The patience paid off and we went home with 14 sliders and fries for free!The customer service was amazing. Curious casino patrons would peek into the White Castle and sure enough an employee would come over to answer questions and encourage them to come back in a few days when they officially open.

We BOTH left (my husband and I) with FOOD POISONING and we BOTH ended up in urgent care on Memorial Day and still too sick to return to work today!

I had tried the frozen ones before and didn't care for them and was assured by many that I had to try the real thing.  I was excited that White Castle had opened in Vegas since it was more likely that I would make it to Vegas than the east coast.  Final the Vegas trip was booked and I was excited to try out White Castle.  Flash forward to Sunday morning.  The breakfast debate begins and me and my home skillet decide on White Castle.  Since its Vegas it's open 24/7 so why not!  White Castle is located on the strip in the Casino Royale.  The store front is located on the strip and easy to find.  As you walk in it feels like any fast food restaurant.  Ordering was quick, easy and friendly.  We ordered the 2 person combo with 10 sliders (5 with cheese, 5 original), a fry, an onion chip and two soda's for a little over $20.  Our order was up pretty quick.  They do require you show your receipt when you pick up your order.  I'm sure this is a safety measure as I can imagine as day turns to night and the party animals are on the loose there has been previous burger burglaries.  The moment has arrived the tiny little boxes of meat onions and bread is before me!  I take my first bite and.....it's alright.  I figure it's a east coast thing.  I'll stick to my my west coast In n' Out.  The restaurant itself was good, I can't blame them for my taste buds being born and raised on the west coast.

I was sure to place my order as quickly as possible (we ordered the #2 cheeseburger, fries, and drink), so at least the cashier appeared to merely tolerate me as I paid. This place has only been open a few weeks and the employees at the front are already burnt out. What's up with that? With so much unemployment in Vegas, couldn't they have found a few cashiers who are a bit friendlier?As for the food - well, it's White Castle. It is what it is. Tiny, thin burger in a plain bun, with a bit of cheese and onion. There's a burger in there, but can anyone really taste it? I estimate the ratio of bun to burger is about 8:1, so you'll have to eat a huge amount of bun before you get much burger in your tummy! The fries were just bleh.About the location - I'm not sure where to park to get into this place. There is no parking in front, so we ended up parking in the Venetian and walking back to the Strip, but surely there's a spot closer than that? Also, there were TWO security guards working this location, which only amplified the negative vibes in this place.

This small shop is located next to the Harrah's on the east side of a small casino. As you may already know, parking on the strip (if you are coming from off the strip) is a pain in the butt, but if you are coming just to have White Castle I would choose a hotel/casino near the Harrah's.The restaurant is pretty small and narrow. Once you walk in there are a few tables including one really long table with seats on both sides of the table. The counter is in the back of the restaurant. The menu is pretty basic; there are a few combos that include the sliders, fries and a drink, sliders that are being sold by themselves and also options to order large amounts of sliders! We ordered a regular combo, but added a few more sliders to our order. They came out quick and hot... and they tasted just like I imagined a fresh White Castle Slider would taste like... my childhood nostalgia. I easily packed away like 7 sliders without blinking, but boy do you pay for it later.I have friends that have visited the Midwest and told me that White Castle was delicious, but gives you gnarly gas... and boy does it!

This past time we went, we tried 1 of almost every slider available. Here's my personal ranking from best to worst:Double cheese slider Original slider w/ egg and cheese Cheese slider Fish slider and veggie sliderChicken ring slider and chicken breast sliderI hope that makes sense. I honestly couldn't tell the difference between the two chicken sliders. The fries are a must here, especially when they're freshly fried.

You basically order for the group or small orders for 1 person. Obviously we went for the 20 burger combo with fries and the chicken rings. Seeing how the burgers are made is mesmerizing. The kitchen is pretty open compared to other fast food restaurants where large machines cover the process. White Castle however lays everything out for you to admire and salivate while you order. They cover the grill with the chopped onions and then place the patties on top. It is definitely a sight to see. 20 minutes later, we got out food which was well worth the wait. Those little sliders are so delicious and fresh. You almost feel bad as you count how many you eat from the 20 burger combo. The onions are probably my favorite part.

What a disappointment!! First timers are going to wonder what all the fuss is about . The burgers were lacking flavor, not hot and you had to look for the onions - and as we all know that gives this little (but expensive) burger the flavor and steam needed to make that bun so special. Neither were there. The bun top actually made it a bit dry since there was NO ketchup and cold! As a local, I will buy the frozen ones and not make the trip to the strip for this $1.29 miss .

Had the regular beef sliders, chicken sliders, and cheese fries. The beef I found was pretty thin, but the toppings and the fluffy bun def made it taste above average. The chicken lacked toppings and was a tad dry. The cheese fries are good, but you could probably make your own easily at home. Overall, it was a mediocre experience for me. At the end of the day, it's fast food. So if you just want something relatively quick and cheap, this could be one of your options.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	3	2015-11-19	0	0

A last minute decision to eat something reasonably priced lead me here. So here's my verdict: Cheeseburger- 2.5 stars Jalapeño cheeseburger- 3.75 stars. The white cheese is a nice change of pace from American cheese, adds a slight kick and adds an extra oomph to the overall burger compared to the regular cheese. Fish burger- 3 stars Crinkle cut fries- 3 stars. Just average. Onion chips- 3.5 stars. Good breading, nicely fried. Have had better but not too shabby for fast food. 7 burgers, one drink, and onion chips came out to about $19. I'll be back for the onion rings and the jalapeño cheeseburger.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	3	2016-06-13	2	0

This place is like a cheap imitation while charging almost double for it.  First issue is the fact they don't add ketchup like they do at all white castles.  I had to tear all of my burgers apart to add ketchup which being sliders was cumbersome.  Even the guy I complained to who is from NJ said """" we don't do that, even though all of the other ones do it"""".Second issue was the quality.  The burgers weren't fully cooked, since the patties are so thin, this is very hard to screw up.Third issue was the fries.  They were much thinner and far less quantity than the normal white castles.Fourth issue was the very loud intercom, they yell almost every 15 seconds your order numbers.  This interrupts the dining experience and hurt my ears.If you want the real white castle experience I highly suggest you skip this horrible excuse for a white castle and go to an established one."""	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	2	2015-02-06	0	0

Anyway, we came in at around 6pm on a Wednesday and was pleasantly surprised that there wasn't a long line. We ordered sliders with the American cheese and jalapeño cheese, fries, chicken rings, onion chips, and a drink. We also got the brownie and cheesecake dipped in fudge for dessert. We wanted to try everything on the menu basically lol the food came out pretty fast. It really fell flat on the food. Everything was really bland. There's no seasoning whatsoever on anything. The sliders were kinda soggy. The onion chips had such a thick coating with no flavor. The best thing we had was probably the brownie for dessert lol it's cool to try if you're curious since it's quite famous. Just don't expect a lot so you won't get disappointed.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	3	2015-12-03	3	3

Oh man we expected too much those burgers were so gross it tasted like something you can feed to a dog, after the first bite I wanted to puke.  It even got us sick ugh I seriously don't think it's real meat I don't know the quality was horrible.

Reportedly, people waited long hours for the infamous tiny sliders. I didn't wait for it personally, but I did see the extreme amount of people in line as I was exploring other (and better) food options. And now it's here not as a mobile restaurant, but an actual restaurant, hidden away in the Casino Royale. To find it, you need to walk a little bit, so make time for that. I don't mind playing tourist in my own city every now and then, but lemme tell ya, for White Castle? Not worth it!The little sliders are, at best, just cute. The meat was dry and it didn't help that the regular sliders were like 90% buns and meat. There were onions and pickles on it but it seemed like 2 little tiny pieces of diced onions, and a pickle the size of a dime. I prefer the cheese sliders over the regular ones.About 5-6 sliders can fill me up really good on a hungry day, so order accordingly. The way they fill up the beer with the magnet is pretty cool! :) Oh, and perks, 10% off for locals with a local ID!I'd say this place isn't really worth the hassle to get... maybe a good place to stop by when you're playing tourist in your own city, but that's about it.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	2	2015-08-29	3	4

Of course that was many years ago and you could get them for around 25 cents, that's really showing how long ago that was. So I was glad to see one open here on the strip. So I packed up the wife (who never had one) and off we went. After a short walk and a short line we ordered. Shocked by the prices, but everything costs more today. Told the wife how good these were while growing up. I guess all things change from what I remember. As soon as I pulled the burger from the package it seemed the burger was way thinner than I remembered and after the first bite I was disappointed on the taste. Guess this is off our list on coming back along with the """"shake shack"""" also. How disappointed this was from the memories of my youth.

For many years, I have been wanting to try this hoping that I would be blown away from the taste. Since they do not have this chain down south, where I stay, I had not been able to taste it.  Until one day, I was driving by the vegas strip and noticed it tucked deep in the sidelines of the Casinos.  After some tricky parking, and a long trek I was finally at the register ordering the cheese slider meal.  At first glance, everything seemed good, heck it sure did make for a great instagram post, which is mandatory for me on all food I eat.  After the first bite, I was left unimpressed.  I would easily rank Fatburger and In and out above this chain and even Mcdonalds.  It was definitely great to finally try it but would not go out of my way to do it again.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	3	2016-02-10	2	1

Anyways, if you're in Vegas, White Castle is a MUST if you're on the strip. Especially when you're drunk. Their burgers are like sliders, small but they're less than $2! They are delicious! They are located near Fat Tuesday and Harrah's hotel. If you aren't in any of the states that has a White Castle, Target sells frozen boxes of White Castle sliders. It won't be the same but it's close!	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	5	2017-04-07	0	1

At that time I never knew it was a restaurant. Then the popularity from Harold & Kumar happened making want to always try a White Castle restaurant. I finally had my chance this summer in Las Vegas! I was actually feeling like a little kid again as we were on our way walking up the strip looking for this place! A special adventure! I was so happy to finally eat at a White Castle! To me, this was the first mini burger I have ever had, so it was unique. I ordered the 20 pack of sliders and 2 regular fries combo pack. $25.99 before tax. Sitting down and laying them all out for my girlfriend and I people thought it was all to myself since she was in the restroom. I laughed and said no, I could have eaten all of it, but not today :P The burgers tasted exactly like the frozen ones, just a bit fresher. Not too surprising, would give them a 3 stars. But the extra star for me was the service and overall experience I got from finally eating at this place! Highly recommended for a quick burger bite! Would go back again next time I visit Vegas!	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	4	2015-11-23	0	0

I grew up in the midwest, so I happen to love them!  So, I can't help it...  It is a true guilty pleasure.  They are simply little steamed cheeseburgers of joy.  Soft, fluffy and delicious!  I always just get the cheeseburger sliders.   The line here in Vegas can move slow if there are a crowd of people, but the burgers are as good as any White Castle in Chicago.

2	4aRespr3mEIxRRoW9tio2A	A9bb4tYbnlilkQCsB05sPg	I wanted to try this place because I heard from people that it was a good fast food joint.To start off, their location is quite terrible. Unless you are walking on the strip, it takes quite an effort to get to the restaurant since you have to go through people and traffic, park at a casino, then walk down the strip to eat here. When it comes to waiting, the time you wait in line to order is a lot longer than the time to get your food. My friend and I ordered #9, 3 cake on a stick, chicken rings, and onion chips. Literally, right after we ordered it took about 30 seconds for us to get all of our food. The quality of the food is disappointing and it might be because of how busy they are. The sliders weren't anything great and their fries are not crispy at all. Their chicken rings didn't have much flavor in them either. However, their onion chips and cheesecake on a stick were amazing.Their service is a lot better than I assumed. The worker who took my order was extremely kind, patient, and helpful. Everyone looks like they're trying their best to work as quickly as possible to meet every customer's needs.To be honest, White Castle is okay but it just wasn't for me.

2	YApG_XpSXamn_itlOXQCBw	-PkAOH3-X0ulik2VYyThSQ	White castle is like bubba gump, famous from a movie. The only difference that white castle was in existence before the movie came out.  We went to Vegas and slave girl has never been to white castle yet, so for love, I went to another bad place to eat. The service was actually good. The lady at the counter was super friendly and very pleasant. Ordering was easy and fast. Good job. We ordered a 10 pack burger with 6 pc chicken ring and loaded fries. Now on with the food. White castle burgers are cheap but small. The burger patty was thinner than a sausage patty but flavorful. However, the flavor was not the typical burger flavor and I wasn't a fan of that taste. The chicken ring was nuggets smashed with a hole in the middle. Dry and nasty. Our friend ordered this onion thing but it was also dry with almost no trace of onion. The only thing that was decent was the loaded fries. I think we just liked bacon. All and all, you gotta wonder why eating White Castle in Vegas when we were surrounded with some of the best restaurants in the country.

You get in line of your own free will, if you don't want to wait then go elsewhere. I also will not rate based on comparisons to other fast food empires (in-n-out, shake shack, McDonald's, etc).  What I am basing my rating in is the food. Let me be completely clear here...if you have ever had the frozen, microwaveable grocery store White Castle sliders then be advised that it is EXACTLY the same as what you will get here. Kudos (I guess) to whoever produces the frozen versions available at the grocery stores because they have 100% matched the taste, consistency, texture and quality of the famous White Castle slider. I wouldn't waste my money on that stuff at the market so I certainly would not ever walk in to another White Castle brick & mortar restaurant location.

Tried the Las Vegas location on a short trip recently.  It's a bit tough to get to.  I parked at the Venetian and took the long walk all the way to the strip to get to the restaurant.  It's not necessarily big but there should be enough tables to accommodate who's in line.If you've had White Castle before, I always say its good if its late night eats or if you're pretty drunk, or both.  Other than that, the food isn't exceptionally great.  In fact, it's actually a bit on the expensive side.  A four slider meal with a handful of crinkly fries and a coke goes for about $10 after tax.  Not really cheap.  You actually might still be hungry after that.  I don't hate it but if it was a few bucks cheaper, I think it would be a better value for your buck.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	3	2015-10-17	4	2

The first time I went there was good. I know it's on the Strip and I expected it to be packed so that wasn't a problem. I went here a second time and this is why I won't ever be back. After waiting in line for 20 minutes I finally ordered a dozen burgers to go. I don't care for onions so I ordered those burgers without them and the lady repeated that. I waited several more minutes for them to come out--my mistake was not checking them in the restaurant. I drove all the way home only to find out these burgers had been completely caked in onions. After scraping off a massive amount of onions, reheating the burgers and having my meal I decided to call the restaurant to inform them of their mistake. I was surprised when no one answered. I tried a few more times. Nothing. The next day I tried calling and still nothing. So I left a voicemail with my contact information. I waited a few days and received no type of reply back. At this point I gave up. If they can't even reply to a customer then they don't deserve my business. White Castle can be good but this location has a big ego being the only one in Vegas. If you do encounter a problem you will have to personally go in and inquire about it. No one cares enough to call back. Just a forewarning.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	1	2017-02-02	0	0

I've had my share of burgers including WC in NYC and they did not bring their A-game to LV.Long lines, greasy burgers, no seating, and wafer thin patties for a premium price.  Also, if you've had WC on the Easy Coast, you'll be disappointed to find that they only sell the regular or cheese burgers and you can't buy them individually.   Only in meals.  I was pretty hungry the day I went, and didn't even eat all of my burgers. And it wasn't because I was full. Nuff said.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	2	2015-04-08	3	2

I don't get why people are so crazy about this place Had this three times over my last Vegas trip but only because it was close to the palazzo and conveniently open 24hours so we could grab some grub after the club. It was okay the first time because I was drunk but the second night I was sober and it's really just mediocre. Everyone else devoured the sliders but I was far too sober to be enjoying them. Tastes like something I could've heated up from my freezer. Pack of 10 costs about $11 and $3 extra if you want to add cheeseBut there's really nothing special or note worthy about the food.

Ordered the 10 mini burgs with cheese, large fries, cheesecake, and cheese sticks.It was cool. I mean, for $20 or so, it was cool.Burgers were hot, fresh, bite sized. Cheesecake was REALLY small for being a cheesecake (on a stick!).I think the plus was the funny cashiers and the 10% OFF FOR LOCALS!!!!!!!!	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	3	2017-03-03	5	6

I love them and couldn't wait for them to get here I went the opening day.  i was not happy with the price.  They should be ashamed for charging people so much.  I brought them the first day and will not come back.  $8.99 for 4-cheeseburgers, fires, and soda are you people crazy.  My 11 yr old grand daughter can eat that and more because the burgers are so small. .I paid $15 plus some change for that combo plus 4-burgers.  That was my usual order after the club in Chicago and Minneapolis.  It  cost me $6 plus some change for the same order the last time I had them in Minneapolis.  I have not lived here that long so I have recently had white castles.  Just because it is on the strip that should not make such a big difference.  That is just pure greed!!!  if they open a store off the strip and the prices are within reason I would patronize that store but not on the strip ever again.  It is so sad that companies are so greedy, you people make enough profits give us a break.  This is why I am only giving one star and I hope others follow suit.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	1	2015-04-30	0	0

1	q6xgj7izoqXoTOWE2QyS1w	N5QdUMI74ooWloFND-CYeQ	"""I had my first experience with the White Castle (WC) food truck at the Great American Foodie Fest held in San Diego. I always heard of the business--known for their sliders--and was always interested in tasting one of their products. I guess I just assumed that WC was like the McDonald's of the East Coast, and I wanted to see what it was about those sliders that made them so great (especially after seeing the White Castle excerpt from """"Harold and Kumar""""). There were pre-organized queues and a HUGE WC tent, so I'm sure the vendor expected mile-long lines. However, when we went on the first night the foodie fair was open, there was NO line; only a few people were in front of us so we didn't have to wait long to order and get our grub. Final verdict: After all that hype, I think I was slightly underwhelmed by those sliders. Maybe it's just because I was different from what I was expecting. Was I glad I tried them? Yes, definitely. Would I crave them late at night? Not so much ... if I were craving fast food late at night, I would probably go for Five Guys fries (soooo addictive) or anything from Del Taco or Chick-Fil-A. But here's what my friend and I got, as well as what I would try next time if I ever visited a WC again: """"Cheese Sliders"""": These sliders vary slightly from the """"Original"""" because they include a slide of American cheese. I need cheese in my burgers ... since I take out the tomatoes and pickles, I can't really just have a slider with the burger alone. My friend and I got 2 for $3 (at least these buggers were cheap), and we saw them being mass produced--in that the thin patties were on the grill in multiples and the workers were putting everything together in true assembly-line fashion. The bun was soft and tasted fresh, which was a plus, but the patty--is that what you even call it?--was super thin ... so thin that I could hardly even taste it. It reminded me of a super thin slice of Spam. I liked the fact that the slider was really light--didn't feel heavy and bloated after eating it--but it definitely needed that cheese. I guess I was expecting the slider to be addicting/have some kind of addictive taste since it got so much hype, but that factor was lacking for me. I'm glad for the experience, but I would probably order something different next time. (Seriously, I don't know how people order packs and packs of these). """"Bacon & Cheddar Grilled Chicken"""": I would actually be interested in trying this slider because it has more elements that I like. This medley features savory grilled chicken with a zesty cheddar-cheese sauce and smoky-bacon crumbles. I do like cheese and bacon, so maybe this slider will be slightly more tasty that the """"Cheese Slider"""" that I had. """"Western BBQ Grilled Chicken"""": I love BBQ flavors so this slider sounds like it's right up my alley. It features a savory, grilled chicken slider topped with smoky BBQ sauce and crispy onion rings. I do like BBQ-inspired sandwiches, so I'm down to try this slider one day. """"Fish Sliders"""": I've had fish sliders before that I really liked, so I'm willing to give the WC version a go. It features two fish sliders made with Alaska Pollock and topped with American cheese. You can even upgrade to a combo and add small fries and a soft drink. I'm not the hugest fan of soft drinks, but I would want to add fries to my order ... this is sort of like fish 'n chips, after all, but in slider form. """"Loaded Fries"""": I'm a huge fan of loaded fries, and since the WC version features fries topped with creamy ranch dressing and hickory-smoked bacon crumbles, I'd definitely want to order them some day. """"Brownie on a Stick"""": This dessert sounds really cute and seems to be a great mini indulgence. This treat on a stick features a chocolate brownie dipped in a rich, fudge coating. Brownies are one of my favorite snacks, and everything just tastes better when it's presented in a fun form ... so if I'm craving something sweet after my WC meal, I would go for this. """"Cheesecake on a Stick"""": Like its brownie counterpart, this cheesecake piece is bound to be the best little indulgence after a fast food meal. It's made with light and creamy cheesecake and dipped in a rich, fudge coating. I'm so down to try this chocolate covered cheesecake (both of these dipped dessert options were not available at the truck, so maybe I have to visit an actual WC restaurant to get it ...) """"Bacon, Egg & Cheese Slider"""": This breakfast slider sounds like one of the best ones on the WC menu. It includes freshly cracked, loosely scrambled eggs topped with American cheese and crisp, hickory-smoked bacon on a steamed signature bun. I'm a huge fan of breakfast sandwiches, so I would be willing to try this breakfast slider if I came to WC when the breakfast menu's being featured."""	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	3	2015-04-02	2	1

Really, it's not any different, so I wouldn't make it a point to stop by White Castle when in Vegas, unless you want to try their other items like chicken rings, fries, etc.If you're planning a visit anyway, the deep fried onion petals are a must as a choice of side! Super crunchy and delicious. I don't know about you, but I always felt awkward biting into an onion """"ring"""". These are so much more fun to eat! Just pop those little suckers right into your mouth. I went with somebody who has tried it in New York, and apparently this location doesn't offer everything from the original menu.The mere thought of horseradish makes me cringe and shiver for irrational reasons, so if you and I share that intense disgust for it, stay away from the zesty zing dipping sauce. Had it by accident without knowing what it was. Blarrrggh! I'm not an active environmentalist, but I don't litter and am aware of other issues relating to the matter, so it did sort of break my heart to toss out so much cardboard boxes that only served as brief housing for such dinky sliders :( But I suppose that it's because they are very delicate, and typical wrappers would've squashed them."""	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	4	2015-05-13	27	27

I ordered a 10 slider pack, 2 fries, 1 onion chips, and 2 drinks for $26.There were no seats so we had to snatch a table at the Subway nearby. The wait was long but the word """"crave"""" was scattered all over the walls so I thought that is had to be worth the wait. Welp, I was wrong.I wasn't surprised by the size of the slider, they are meant to be tiny and cute, but I've seen cheese slices thicker than these meat patties. And overall it was bland, no seasoning whatsoever. Crinkle cut fries should have that extra crunch but these were limp and bland as well. Everyone knows to salt the fries straight out of the fryer, except these guys. I sampled a chicken ring from a friend. It's cute but nothing special. My friend did find a little bone in one of his rings. At least we know it's real chicken. The only star of the whole meal were the onion chips.I loved the assembly line but I was disappointed that all of that hard work for food that tasted microwaved.Oh, and did I mention that this morning I woke up to the sound of my boyfriend hurling his heart out?

Just walking in, there isn't much separating white castle from every other fast food joint.I ordered 4 cheese burger sliders with some fries for around $8. Boy, did this place suck. Honestly, minus the cool boxes the sliders are in, the cheese burgers here taste the same as the burgers I microwave. Same goes for the fries. Just salty empty carbs...

Do not come here expecting to have a burger your way with 86 options to choose from, you can venture down the strip if you want to spend 40 bucks on a gourmet burger. This place is serious business here, they have A LOT of employees working in assembly lines preparing burgers, refilling soda machines, stocking up on ketchup, cleaning up as soon as a vacant seat is available, calling out numbers with video screen assistance like the DMV, organized chaos at its finest. The line stayed long, it moved quickly, and the staff was great. I got the cheese sliders, and being a cheese lover I do not think I would enjoy burger as much without it.

My fist impression is that it is a bit strange, they have a very precise process of cooking onions, burgers and buns, and it all appears very methodical. They cook on these little square griddle inserts in the counters and there are multiple little stations. Not sure where their beef comes from, but it does look a bit unappetizing when they are laying it out in the onions, at first I thought they were putting on some sort of red square rubber spacers with holes in them so they can steam the buns with the onion aroma, but nope, those square red Lego looking things are actually the patties. I was aware that they only offer little sliders, but I was not aware that the little sliders cost the same as a full sized burger elsewhere (1 single plain slider with nothing on it costs $1.35), they have to have huge margins here as you get basically a meatball on a roll for the price of a Big Mac. (Not that I condone eating Big Macs)We ordered the meal that came with 4 sliders (with cheese) and some fries, and also ordered 2 of their chicken ring sliders. The chicken ones were actually pretty tasty, tasted very similar to burger kings chicken sandwiches, the sort of over processed ground chicken variety. The sliders were fairly tasty and I did like the idea of eating the little thing, and though they are very basic they taste pretty good, as everything cooks in and with their caramelized onions. I did, however, need to dip the burger in ketchup to get a more deep flavor. I felt like they tasted sort of like a basic McDonald's Cheeseburger and an In-n-out """"Animal Style"""" cheeseburger had a baby (so somewhere I between the quality of the 2 though much more on the McDonald's side).The Fries were also pretty good, though nothing to write home about. They are the wavy variety and not over salted. Because the things were so small, I had the go back and order more food! This time I got 2 more chicken ring sliders and went for 2 double cheese sliders this time, which by the way are over $3 a piece! That's like the price of the """"six dollar burger"""" at Carl's Jr, or the more expensive burgers at about every fast food chain, but again even the double burger is less substantial than a single """"$.99 cent menu"""" burger elsewhere. All in all we ended up spending over $30!!! Just to get full here, that is a ton for a fast food place!I really don't think I'll be back to a White Castle anytime soon, it's possible the craving could hit me when I see one because it is a unique taste, but even then, I'll likely just grab one slider to go and eat it on the way to wherever else I'm going to eat."""	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	3	2015-08-18	0	0

I am still firmly in the I don't get it column.There were three of us and we ordered a 10 pack bag with three bottles of water.  The sliders come out to be just over a dollar each but they were missing something.  Even the devoted sister-in-law thought they were missing at the very least some salt (and she doesn't use salt very much).  I was underwhelmed by the sliders.  The onion taste was about the best thing and it's really stretching it calling that little thin piece of beef a slider.  The thing is mostly bread.Being in the Casino Royale doesn't make it an easily accessible place unless you're a tourist walking the Strip and decide to drop in.

I was expecting delicious small burger sliders with a side of fries for the amount of money I paid. It was horrible. And I don't blame any staff, this iPad to do with the quality of the burger. They basically tasted the same as the microwaveable ones you get at a local food market. Very disappointing. I couldn't even finish the small lil burgers. Would never recommend this franchise to anyone until they find a better supplier for their patties. And stop using microwave food. The fries were ok. The instructions say to """"put mustard on this review"""" (and I wish I woulda put someOn that horrible burger) but I don't wanna sound like I'm trashing this franchise blatantly, I'm sure there's a few that will appreciate the quality of these small burgers.

You would need to be drunk or stoned to enjoy White Castle.I was so excited to try this because relatives on the east coast love White Castle. Plus Harold and Kumar made this place seem like some sort of burger godsend. What a load of crap. Crappy bread, patties, and fries. At least they did the job and the fries weren't too salty.But this is mediocre. In-N-Out is better.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	3	2015-07-18	12	12

I am glad that's all I ordered because it did not taste good at all. First off, the service is cap. They didn't really care about you. The cheddar fries was nothing exciting, it had stale fries. The burger is just nasty! It's soggy with no flavor. Maybe if you are drunk and hungry you can eat here but other than that, I would pass.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	2	2015-08-30	3	2

What with the constant talk on local news stations, blogs, websites how could you not feel the pressure as a lover of food in Las Vegas? We were not immune to the build-up and thus had to see what we were missing all these years. We visited on a Saturday, early evening/late afternoon timeframe. The place was busy, but that was no surprise with the aforementioned popularity still booming. The line was relatively long but moved at a decent rate. They do well to get you through and on your way. We waited about 15-20 minutes in line. The menu is simpler than most fast food type joints with limited offerings. Think somewhere between In n Out and Chil Fil A. I appreciate this; makes it easier for someone like me who wants to get right to the """"bread and butter"""" if you will and skip over their second rate items. The sliders were much smaller than we expected; again we've never had even the frozen grocer variety so expectations were only speculative. It reminded me of a plain McDonalds burger with the small chopped onions being one of the only things on the burgers other than the meat. The fries were nothing special. Not great but also without any major flaw. Straightforward French fries. Our meal was over in less than 10 min and we left feeling quite disappointed, and overall confused about the hype.

I expected there to be a wait so I won't complain about the 1 hour and a half that I stood in line but I will complain that the line is like General admission for the club. I don't think they thought thoroughly about having a line outside on a busy strip sidewalk. Also I wasn't that far back in the line so I thought once I got into the building I would be minutes from ordering. Okay so the food; when I received my burgers they were lukewarm after coming fresh off of a grill! I also ordered chicken rings and they didn't have honey mustard! Dont even get me started on the employees! They need to bring some people from the MIDWEST to train these people. For those who have not had White Castle before this is not what all of us Midwest folks were excited about! It wasn't nearly the experience from back home! I agree with those that said you can go to the frozen section for what they are serving up here. Also they need to figure out how to get one off of the strip and with a drive-thru and breakfast.

I avoid the weekend tourist crowds and always stop there for weekday lunch.  My parking experience has improved since I discovered the back entrance.  The only bad thing about this place is getting in and out of the parking lot, but that's not the restaurant's fault so I won't ding them for that.

And if your fan of the movie(Harold & Kumar) then you must try this place once cause those frozen ones you buy at the grocery store are fake and don't give White Castle anyway justice. I ordered a combo. *Sliders with cheese - Without the cheese they slider would suck so the cheese is good and def a must. *Fries - Crinkle cut and very lacking. Easy pass next time.*Onion Fries - Your combo will be much better if you substitute for these. I like these a lot better. I would probably recommend on skipping on combos and getting a sack. Because 4 sliders aren't really enough. Anyways White Castle isn't anything special but it is appealing at 4-5 AM, if you don't want Hash House or Earls. The service is like any fast food joint. I asked for ranch and the lady said she had to go to back and get some. I waited 5 minutes and she didn't move at all.

I ordered 3 classic sliders while my friends ordered the original slider combo. The line was long and took me 10 minutes to order and another 10 minutes to get my food. When I got my food, I was disappointed. In no way did that resemble a burger slider. The bottom bun was so soggy that it stuck to the packaging. The burger patty was probably 3 millimeters thick. It came with one pickle and grilled onions. The fries were soggy as well and tasted like plastic. The fries tasted like they were frozen and reheated in a microwave. To top it off, the food was not worth the money. It costs almost $10 for a slider combo (drink, fries, 3 slider). I paid $1.30 for each slider that you could finish in 2 bites. The best part of the meal was the drink.The food here closely resembles the frozen, microwaved lunch you get in elemenatry school.

I truly believe I had the  exact same feeling that Harold and Kumar had when they finally arrive at the place where they have been dying to get to all because they have been yearning for those little magical sliders in the pretty little white box.As I stepped through the double glass door from the Las Vegas strip and entered this gold mine I was filled with happiness. Who would have ever thought that we would be so lucky to have a White Castle here, but I guess dreams do come true.The line was not bad and space was pretty small and yes they only have 2 cash register but there was an army of workers in the back cranking out them sliders and the food came out fast. As I am placing my order I am still in disbelief that I didn't have to travel to the east coast to experience this must try burger joint. Any how that was just it. I am giving them a 4 stars because although everything was great the burger itself the one thing that this place is all so famous for was good but I wish was better by being hot and fresh. I totally understand that in order to meet demands and keep customers happy by getting their food quick they must constantly pump out burgers and let them sit there, and that's where it suffers I think. I burgers itself was a little cold. But never the less I was extremely content. I ordered almost every item on the menu because even though I wish it was a hope skip and a jump, it is not easy for us locals to just drive up and pick us up a bag full of burgers...no you must be strategic about it and actually plan your day to enjoy this place and it's food. All in all everything was good and I defiantly will be back again and again. I'm crossing my fingers they will open up other locations where we can just pull up to a drive thru and satisfy our cravings a little easier. I think I have been building up the anticipation about White Castles since the movie Harold and Kumar and never thought I would ever get to taste them or get to one without actually leaving Vegas but now I can. So say what you want about this place I am just so happy that after all these years I Finally Made it to WHITE CASTLES!!!! Thank you for opening one up in Vegas. Oh and the staff was super nice too!!! ***OOPS I PUT THIS PLACE IS DRESSY BUT I MEANT CASULE*** I hope we all could figure that out! LOL"""	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	4	2015-03-08	0	1

The manager should be taken out back and beaten! 4th of July holiday and they have one person working a register and a line out the door! Heaven for bid the manager throws a few more employees on registers to speed up the process or hops on one himself! Worst run business! If u see a line go somewhere else like I did after waiting 30 minutes and not moving as it will be a two hour wait just to order!The debate of $15/hour makes me laugh when I see how a business like this is run! Can't wait till the day they replace workers with computers so we can place our own orders and not have to wait an hour in line at a Slow food Restraunt!	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	1	2016-07-05	0	0

Once you get into the idea that you're eating something completely different, you're on the road to success.I fell in love with these little onion-y meat and bun nuggets in Kentucky. I suppose if you hate onions, you'll hate this. The onions are cooked and the patties and buns are stacked on top steaming everything with that onion-y goodness. These were every bit as good as the ones I've had in Kentucky. Pro Tip: Get a side of onion chips, and order by the sack.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	5	2016-04-03	0	0

I was elated when I heard they were coming to the west coast and was not disappointed. I'm surprised the location is so small so I can only imagine how quickly it fills up. I got the 2 double slider combo and was blown away. So meaty and cheesy, with the onions and pickle to cut through. No condiments necessary.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	5	2015-10-31	0	0

We stopped by on Saturday afternoon around 5:30, it took 45 minutes to wait and order, then another 10 to receive our meal which wasn't too bad.We were able to find a little spot to sit in really quick, the table was clean but the space was tiny. The employees that I dealt with were friendly. I can say that I am glad we took the safe route and ordered very little food, better safe than sorry. I got combo #2 which comes with 4 cheese sliders, an order of fries and a drink for $8.99, I also ordered 6 additional cheese sliders, an order of onion chips, and a fudge dipped cheesecake on a stick (additional burgers were for the kids at home). I ordered all of the cheese sliders without onions. When our number was called my husband picked up the order and brought it back to the table. I opened the bag up and noticed no cheese and onions on the first slider, so it took out one after another and noticed they all had no cheese but they did all have onions, on top of that, I didn't receive my cheesecake. I put the sliders back in the bag and took them back, they threw the sliders away and I waited another 10 minutes to receive the """"correct"""" order. First 4 sliders were fine, cheese and no onions, other 6, cheese with onions. WTF! My receipt clearly stated cheese and no onions for all 10 sliders! At that point I was annoyed so I didn't take them back to the front counter, but seriously, you must really not know what you're doing if you get my order wrong twice. To top it off the burgers were semi-warm, they should be glad I didn't become very disgruntled.I honestly wasn't impressed with the tiny burgers, I took a bite and to my surprise, it tasted just like a McDonald's $1 cheeseburger. The slider consisted of a bun, thin patty, and sliced pickles. The fries weren't anything special either, they tasted just like the crinkle cut fries that you buy at the grocery store and fry up yourself. Onion chips were okay, they were very crisp and had a semi sweet taste to them. The best part of the meal was my orange fanta beverage and the fudge dipped cheesecake on a stick. We spent $25 on our meal and thought it was a complete waste. Meal #2 comes with enough food to fill up a hungry toddler, not an adult. The cost is not justifiable to me, too little food for the price, $1.50 for a tiny cheese slider, no thanks. I came, I tasted, too over-hyped."""	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	2	2015-02-02	9	6
0	ms-e5rZ5wq3odv9sWp97fw	J76Hu13cIN89ACpnOqohyg	I was honestly so dissapointed when I ate there. I honestly do not know what everyone was fussing about how it's the greatest thing in the world. Cons: The line was long, (as suspected since it's new) once you get inside, there's another line. I don't know if they still have long lines since people know it's not the best lol The burgers were tiny and had very little taste to them, which I assume it's how it is in where it came from. It was very expensive for what you got to be honest. It was not good at all, way way over price. Like In-n-Out is better lol The kitchen where you can see them cooking the burgers is very unsanitary looking. There were buns everywhere, chopped onions on the floor, not to mention their was pretty brown lolDO NOT WORRY IF YOU HAVEN'T GONE THERE, YOU'RE NOT MISSING ANYTHING. Pros:...umm they have really good chicken rings? Hope this helps. I honestly would recommend to go there just to taste it just so you can say you've had it but I honestly doubt that anyone is going to return. Unless you're a tourist and drunk at 4 in the morning.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	2	2015-02-26	3	2

If fast food burgers are your goal, I would pick In-N-Out before going to White Castle.  If you compared it to any sort of restaurant style burger, you would remove White Castle from your memory, never to be thought of again.  Don't want to make the journey to WC?

The line was kind of long, about a 15-20 minute wait then an additional 10 min wait.This was my second time eating White Castle. Their sliders were delicious. We ate a lot of them on the ride home. They are small and perfect, I don't get the same guilt trip I do when I eat other burgers. I tried the chicken sliders for the first time, it's not my cup of tea, I just don't think that chicken should be a burger, I also tried their bacon cheese fries, oh my.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	4	2015-02-22	2	2

Yup! My husband has never had WC before so we decided to give it a go. Located at the Best Western Casino Royale, it'll hit you in the face if you're walking down the strip towards Venetian. There are security guards standing at the doors and inside to monitor the lines. We came in at 10ish and were in and out in less than an hour. Guess everyone was still sleeping. By the time we left, the line was out the door!!!About the food:-Original Slider- plain as can be. Onions, beef patty-Cheeseburger Slider- comes with a pickle, onion and cheese. I liked this one best. Had the best flavor because of the pickle. -Chicken Ring Slider- two chicken rings with cheese. I wouldn't order it again and now understand why it needs the cheese. Without it.. Kinda dry.Fries- crinkle cut. Standard!The boo is a fan of the cheeseburgers goodness. My beef (hehe) is that I'm not a fan of the soggy buns. Sorry!

8	F_5_UNX-wrAFCXuAkBZRDw	Z_QijfbyBjb-JWqiDPWrxA	Well, I finally made it to a White Castle.  It is what it is and it doesn't try to be anything more.  And that's basically how a 24-hour food joint on the strip should be.  Be noted that I came here right after having a Filet Mignon at Mon Ami Gabi, so I really came in here with lower expectations.I like cheeseburgers so I went with their Castle Combo No. 2 which had 4 cheeseburgers, fries, and a drink (http://bit.ly/1d7fHzH).  I can describe these little cheeseburgers in two words:  Salt Bombs!  These little suckers were pretty damn salty.   I think after every bite I just keep going for my soda to soak it all up.  Despite the saltiness, the cheeseburgers weren't that bad!  But it might be because I had some alcohol beforehand.  And definitely better than getting them frozen ones at the supermarket.  For just under $10, the combo was decent.Luckily when I arrived to White Castle at around 10:30pm, there wasn't a line to order.  So my experience was pretty quick as it should be.  But when I walked by at around midnight, the place was super packed so I was glad that I just had beat the late night munchie rush.  Amazing!Despite the novelty, I don't know if I'd come back to White Castle again.  If I want a burger on the Strip late at night, there are plenty of other options at around the same price range.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	3	2015-06-22	17	12
0	E7p6lj9gQ9qLTIvjtVr7rQ	XBEowW6g7zMGJzOE31DXRg	I honestly don't really see the hype about this place either. Ate here about two or three times during EDC week, because it was right next to our hotel, opened late (maybe even 24 hours?) and is cheap.The burgers are okay, cute and little but not really flavorful. Bland I might add. Fries are okay too. The best item on their menu is probably the chicken rings, and they're not even known for that. The employees are rude and the food doesn't really come out as fast as you would think for a fast food joint. . .Oh Harold & Kumar, you guys definitely got my hopes up. I can see how one may find this place delicious if under the influence of marijuana.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	3	2015-08-07	1	0
5	dsaj_eA71FvpUh49zzKcGA	liaEdz5jJ_4oQeP6w96r9w	"""Simply put - their burgers/sliders suck. I walked in with pretty low expectations and they didn't even meet that. But you're likely going to check out White Castle anyway whether it's out of morbid curiosity like I did, or because of nostalgia. I stopped by on opening day because I was walking distance away and had a friend already in line. The line moved relatively quickly, but White Castle way underestimated the wait time. It's nice that they handed out free sliders as a sorry, but ironically that well intended gesture made me consider getting out of line after sampling their sliders. But I promised to bring WC back for other people, so stayed in line.Great service for a fast food place especially on opening day. Everybody was helpful nice, and smiley despite all the chaos - I read they were churning out around 4,000 sliders an hour, which is insane. I've never been to another WC before, but heard that they're normally priced around 80cents each vs the cheapest you'll get it here is $1.09 with the 100 pack. They can say the higher prices are due to higher rent on the strip, but that's bs - they would've made up for that with the ridiculously high volume this location will do, so they're just plain greedy. But what can you do - it's the only WC west of... think it was Missouri? Anyway, back to their crappy burgers. Yes I know that sliders are small, but paying over $1 for something that's 1/18th of a pound of weird gray """"beef"""" is just silly. For comparison, a McDonalds hamburger (also crappy) is 1/10th of a pound and at least looks more like real beef than this does. The bun was ok and I like grilled onions, but I did not enjoy tasting them for the rest of my day.  I guess it's WC's thing that they never dress the sliders for you - want some ketchup and mustard? Too bad, you get grilled onions and pickles - anything else you have to add to it yourself. Not a huge deal, except that you need to know to ask for it, then wait for the guy to get packets from the back because they don't have them out to just grab. And he only gave me 1 packet each of ketchup, mustard and mayo for 10 sliders, so thanks for that because ketchup and mustard were the only things that gave the burger any taste.  Also ordered a chocolate shake because the lady said they're amazing since they're made from frozen custard not ice cream or soft serve. It was a decent but overpriced shake, which was so thick that I couldn't drink it through a straw. I have no idea if that's how they always are, but a spoon would've been nice. I would normally say well I didn't like it, however you should probably try it out for yourself. In this case I have to say eff it - skip the lines and the clusterf*ck we call the strip and just pick up the frozen ones from the market. They sadly do taste about the same and I think are cheaper."""	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	3	2015-02-04	6	6
0	BDmxm7aeWFOLT35gSvkmig	Z9d6iJlJg64ELkRh_8oYsA	I'd like to start this review with a question. On an average day how many sliders does this place serve? Pretty curios about that. Anyways anybody that grew up back east should know White Castle. This is the first location in the west so of course it had to go on Las Vegas Blvd. Not sure what some people were expecting or built up in their minds about this place. It's exactly the same it's always been just higher prices (not extreme though) because of the location. As a Vegas local and someone that grew up with eating here I can say it's good but not deserving of more than 3 stars. PROSSame White Castle you have always had. If you enjoyed them in the past you will enjoy them hereThey serve beer which is pretty cool Dining area seems to be well kept and clear of trash CONSLocation..  Good for the company I'm sure but locals absolutely hate coming to the strip. I understand why the first one had to go here but wish now there was an easier one outside of the strip to get to Size.. As I said well kept and clean but not nearly big enough for the amount of foot traffic that comes through. Some employees... Look I work with drunk asshole tourists everyday too so I understand what they go through but there are some (not all) here that have just  nasty attitudes. Granted it's a few bad apples but they leave an impression. A few times the fries were old/cold and asked politely for new ones and have been met with sighs and eye rolls. Please expand into the local area!	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	3	2016-07-27	1	2
8	QtGXr3Y74fnWfdWpGJIldw	lpSOGhNDdnJ_fVPA9a_r6g	When I heard about White Castle coming to Vegas, I honestly got excited about it. I've never been to one of their locations before but I figured it would be a cool experience, especially seeing it practically get famous from Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle (I can't believe that movie is 11 years old now!)Located on the Casino Royale side of the Strip, White Castle offers cheap sliders at any time of the day. I honestly think it's better than most fast food chains, but it tasted the same as the microwaveable ones you can buy at the grocery store.The breakfast slider was pretty good, though. It really isn't anything special because it's just a sausage patty with an egg, but it does the trick if you want something simple and filling for breakfast.It's not a gourmet burger joint, but it's definitely nice to have one of these on the Strip. The cheap prices and better quality food than other fast food chains are what makes White Castle a winner in my book! It might be a little too over-hyped, but it's still a place to visit just to say you've been to one.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	4	2015-09-22	11	9

A recent trip to Las Vegas with my Chicago born girlfriend certainly changed it around for me. First, it's not the in and out type burger most will want. It's a small steamed burger, and it tastes great. Small sliders that are bite sized is what White Castle is all about. Quick service and overall great place in my mind.Yes, the prices were high, but drive 1200 more miles if you want the closer one, and you'll pay the higher than normal prices for them there. It's Vegas, get over it, most of everything in Vegas is overpriced. Great times and good food.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	4	2015-04-09	0	0

The music, videos playing, conversations, and sights made the long wait in line not so bad. Once we got our orders, we were able to find a seat, surprisingly. Burgers were cooked well. Chicken rings were crunchy.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	3	2016-04-29	0	0

Living in So Cal, we don't have the opportunity.  Low and behold signs on the way to Vegas advertising for White Castle. No traffic, no crowds, no parking issue was going to keep us from going.  Park behind and walk to the front of the strip location. The customer service was great, the location is clean and inviting and the food was so, so delicious.The burgers were just as good as I had hoped, and the dipping sauce zangy sauce was OUTSTANDING.  I tried to find a copycat recipe of it online, but have failed.  I will definitely, be back when in Vegas again! Love White Castle.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	5	2017-05-01	0	0

After seeing all the horrendous pictures of the barely edible-looking food, I was pretty sure I would never go, I was wrong.Out of sheer morbid curiosity, we arrived at White Castle a few weeks ago and saw no line and figured it was as good a time to try as any. We shared some sliders with cheese and chicken rings along with some fries. Prices were a bit steep, but that's to be expected for the strip. I was surprised that the food wasn't as awful as I was expecting. It wasn't necessarily good, either. I favored the chicken rings to the sliders, which as people have noted are steamed and therefore have a mushy texture that I didn't enjoy. The fries were forgettable, so I'd avoid those.Their drink and ice machines weren't working and people were bottle necking fighting for the one side that was actually functioning. All in all, I guess I'm glad I gave them a try, but it looks like one and done for me.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	2	2015-04-11	9	7

Yeah, it's crap fast food but we couldn't pass it up.Girl at the front was super nice. It didn't seem like anyone hated their job. There was a constant line, so obviously business is well.

Much more costly than other states i heard as it's suppose to be a quarter each. We got 4 cheeseburger sliders with a drink and fries and it was $8.99.The sliders were pretty gross. I think some frozen sliders even taste better. The bread were soggy on the bottom as if my bun was accidentally dropped in water. What makes it worse is its not water but the bun soaked up the fat juice from the meat (which some may like but a soggy bun, no thank you). The meat looked old and not fresh at all. One picture that a fellow yelper posted says it all. Service was ok. Some were super nice while some looked as if they just crawled out of bed or have a bad hangover. Definitely a one time visit for me. Never again.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	1	2015-03-27	1	0

I payed a little less than $20 tax included for 4 sliders (okay), 2 sodas, 1 chicken ring box thing(mediocre), and a tiny cheesecake on a stick. The cashier that helped me was great! They didn't seemed overwhelmed at all despite the line going out and around the corner of the street.

3	dYCmh8rJl_ZkC_mt70ZDhQ	Uy54cfMrRSgm0TMNfg99og	"""This is the very 1st White Castle to have opened in the West Coast!  It opened on January 27th, 2015; and it was the very 1st time in 56 years that a White Castle has expanded in a different state. The 1st time I ever had a White Castle slider was back in the 90's when Costco used to sell them in their freezer section.  I didn't even know that they were a fast food chain since there weren't any in the West Coast.  After Costco stopped selling these, I never heard of White Castle again until the film """"Harold & Kumar Goes to White Castle"""" was released in 2004.  Ever since I saw that movie, I've always had a craving for White Castle.  When I went to New York in 2008, it was the very 1st time that I ever dined at a White Castle establishment. When I went to Las Vegas in 2015, I was pleasantly surprised to see this White Castle since they've only had their restaurants in the mid-West & the East Coast.  I had to give them a try!  This is a cleaner White Castle than their other locations, and it was fun to sit by the window and """"people-watch"""" the folks walking on the strip.  As for the food.., it's your typical White Castle.  Small portions & very greasy.  You always have to order more sliders than you think, if you just have a normal appetite; and even more sliders if you're really hungry!  What makes this White Castle unique is that they serve breakfast items from 5am - 11am, and they also sell cold draft beer. It's a good place to get cheap food at any hour of the day/night.  In the past, the only place to get 24/7 fast food was at McDonald's.  It's a novelty to finally have a White Castle in the West Coast; but at the end of all things.., it's still just a fast food chain.  It's just nice to have another alternative than the McDonald's on the Las Vegas strip."""	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	3	2016-01-11	4	4

This time we looked past the prices and just fixated on the food. The burgers were as good as any WC anywhere but the fries weren't exactly fresh. So while I could knock them for the fries, it's a White Castle and it was a WC experience  The line wasn't long, the wait for the food was alright and the burgers were as good as any. They don't serve win mustard and ketchup but when you have such a massive operation as the LV location you make allowances. Kudos for a great """"dinner"""".

The burger meat is weirdly thin and I question what kind of meat was used, but combined with the fried onion topping it's a pretty tasty burger! The fries sucked though. They were just bland.The old man working the cash was extremely nice. After we told him we're from Canada and it was our first time at WC he gave us a rundown of how they make their burgers and pointed to each station behind him as he explained the cooking process to us. He won a place in my heart that day.My only negative comment (other than the fries) was I thought it was going to be cheaper?? Maybe I got Vegas pricing...	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	4	2016-01-28	1	1

The location jams this eatery between to other stores and makes it hard to find if not for the giant castle on the front. This is definitely a drunk food choice. Nothing better than downing as much as you can late at night when most other places are closed. A great place to experience. But maybe only experience once.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	3	2017-06-11	0	0

0	b-BS7PbHh2GDcHoeohIVrA	Cg3S7dZufTdcevW_ebFkDg	My experience here was not how I envisioned it. I envisioned my experience at White Castle the same as Harold and Kumar, enjoying endless sliders in absolute joy, basically having the best meal of my young life. Unfortunately that does not hold true and eating at White Castle makes me appreciate In-N-Out that much more. The sliders here are very thin, soggy, and underwhelming. They do have a strong flavor of onion as they are grilled on a bed of onions. The price of each slider is pretty ridiculous at 1.29 each because you need about 4-5 to be anywhere near satisfied. I happened to enjoy the chicken ring slider, as it was fulfilling and lathered with some liquid crack, in the form of cheese, which was very pleasant to eat. If I was hella drunk out of my mind I would probably order 20 of these easy. The onion peels take on the shape of a garlic clove and are deep fried. They taste just like onion rings and are not anything too special at all. I wouldn't mind coming back to White Castle if it somehow it magically ended up in the Bay Area, but if I'm in Vegas again, I would definitely waste my money on something actually worth spending on.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	2	2016-12-20	2	2

Everyone is curious about White Castle and what they have to offer. All we had before were the microwaveable burgers, and that certainly cannot match up to a restaurant's quality of burgers, right? Well... White Castle is certainly good, but maybe not as good as we hoped. I would say it is slightly better in the store than it is from the frozen burgers. One view I have is that the bread and meat is not cooked long enough. If they were cooked an extra thirty seconds to a minute, it would taste much better in my opinion. The texture of the burgers are very similar to the microwaveable version, that is one thing that makes me not think it's that great. Their fries were pretty good, as well as their chicken rings, and that's what brings it up a little for me. The location isn't the greatest, but it isn't too far away from things where you have to go so far out of your way for it. It is a bit pricy in my opinion for the amount of food that you get, but what do you expect, it's the only White Castle on the west coast. It definitely is worth the experience, but not much more than that to me.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	3	2015-09-20	1	1

However, for me the double cheeseburgers were awesome! They nailed it! Onion chips (think cut up rings) were very good as well.Negatives were the smaller menu (would love some jalapeno burgers), location is not the best, gets a bit crowded/long lines, over priced for sure, and the fries, meh, still not very good.Still, living in Phoenix now, I am thrilled I can get great sliders without having to fly back to Chi-town - I would definitely hit this place every time I was in town."""	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	4	2017-05-30	0	1

The employees were so nice, and didn't seem stressed at all considering the craziness they've gone through these past few days. They taste just like NY, brings back a lot of memories. The only downfall is the price, they range from $1.10-$1.50 each. NY is like half the price.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	5	2015-01-30	1	1

These certainly did not hit the spot! I know sliders don't have much meat but these were practically meatless! And the onions could've tasted a whole lot better. The Fries were meh too as they were a bit soggy.Not gonna lie, I enjoyed the microwave White Castle burgers you get from the grocery better...	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	2	2017-04-12	1	1

1	RRJBBsdINOnAeplLOg6OVA	RYwcghMWZTIUKIqFz_FHFg	White Castle on the west coast?HELL YES...My Harold and Kumar dreams have come true!Located across from The Mirage, between Casino Royale and The Venetian. Now expectations wise don't be amazed. Yeah it's good. Pay $1.39 for a 2 bite burger isn't exactly the bang for buck but it's unique and it has a history..and a movie after it!Make sure you get cheese. My east coast fam flamed me for ordering a crave case (30) pack of original.. so don't make the same mistake.Quite frankly it adds up to $15 or so bucks to get decently satisfied if you're a moderate eater. It'll hold up in Vegas fine. Quick service, surprisingly nice workers and decent burgers.So go get wasted or high or both , have an epic journey throughout the Vegas strip, stop by here and earn your H&K moment.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	3	2015-08-05	1	2

I'm not really sure what I was expecting, but this has been a questionable item on my bucket list since the first Harold and Kumar movie.  Being a west coast girl, this was adventurous fast food cuisine for me.  Turns out the hamburgers taste pretty much exactly like the microwaved versions you buy in the grocery store.  The chicken rings taste a bit like breaded shoe leather, definitely don't bother ordering those.There can be a a significant wait to get your order, and the dining area is suffused with a quiet, desperate sadness, so if there are no available tables, go get (a lot) of drinks elsewhere and try again later.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	2	2016-04-05	0	0

1	zm-hlrRV5Az12Zvjw01i7g	ptg4kx2BVSVp6WmqMawaIw	TBH I only wanted to try this place out because of Harold & Kumar. Lol Since they opened this location in Vegas, I decided to try this place out.Location: This place is located on the strip near the Palazzo Hotel and right next to Walgreens. It's right across the street from The Mirage and Treasure Island. Parking: You're gonna have to park at a nearby hotel and walk over if you aren't already staying at them because it is located directly on the strip.Menu: Pretty straight forward. Original or Cheese Sliders. They serve beer on tap! How awesome is that?! Lol You can also buy meal packages, sets of 30, 100 lolBoyfriend and I opted for 10 cheese sliders and 5 original to compare and we heard they were small. ** TIP- You will not like these sliders if you do not like onions. I only like onions if they're cooked or caramelized or depending on my mood. I know I'm weird. LolI had low expectations going into this place despite reading other reviews. The cheese sliders wasn't too bad. I would eat it again. The cheese was so gooey and blended well with the onions and meat party. The original one was just too plain. The cheese definitely makes it taste 10x better. I don't recommend the original ones at all. The also come in cute little boxes. This place would definitely be great drunk food lol but it's not amazing but it's not bad either! I just can't see myself craving it all the time. Check this place out at least once so you can say you tried it!	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	3	2015-08-14	7	2
0	FSdts-TifeFxj88NPtmwjA	G-AFoWkZjpa3BxyROU4hyA	After all those days of feasting on frozen white castle burgers... I finally tried it for real... and the disappointment was real...My friend and I were ambition as hell and ordered the 30-pack of cheeseburgers.... after our lunch which was no more than 2 hours prior. That was about 2250 calories for each of us... (A package of 2 frozen ones is like 300 calories). We took our first bites and continued to much due to excitement... but the flavor sunk in. Wait, scratch that, what flavor? Compared to their frozen counterparts, these lacked salt, umami, msg, etc etc. Not satisfying at all... we left defeated.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	2	2016-10-15	1	1

Lines can be long but once you order the food it comes out pretty fast. The sliders were nothing to rave about... Super simple- patty, pickles (gross) & onions.  My favorite thing here were probably the onion chips. (Similar to onion rings but smaller pieces) Their chicken rings reminds me of Burger King's chicken fries.  I'd honestly need at least 3 or 4 sliders to fill up.  The menu only shows the combo prices. Sliders are $1.59 each. If you want something different than your usual fast food joint then this place may be it. I just wouldn't go out of my way to come here.  MEHHH.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	3	2015-03-31	1	0
0	1bFBIbi4KVxkWGNBVWlPdw	Wap4jWEuPsCOcxlCT8AqIg	Great first time and I'm digging the sliders so hard. I've wanted to try White Castle for a while but I'm unsure of where one is in my area. Finally got my chance to and I don't regret it. The prices of the sliders were delightful and affordable. Quality isn't top notch but I feel like it's more enjoyable than a McDonald's burger. And it simply melts in your mouth, it was great, I didn't know that a slider could run like gold down your throat. I was also really big on the free onion ring slices that came with the sliders. That was amazing! I didn't even ask for that and there they were! I think that's a thing? Am I wrong? Or did the server just love me that much? I'd like to think it's both. Yeah probably both. While I loved the flavor of what I ate, White Castle is definitely more of a late night snack than a stomach bloating meal. For me at least.  But I loved it none the less.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	5	2015-07-25	0	0

38	zFYs8gSUYDvXkb6O7YkRkw	rlh_Sk5croW4D1Mqu9CzRg	Okay, so this place is more like 3.75 stars but whatever.  I'm gonna give them a four despite hearing all of Yelp scorning me on my check-in ( :P ).  Hey, we don't have a White Castle in Arizona and I have wanted to try an actual White Castle forever.  Even before I saw Harold & Kumar, I enjoyed their frozen sliders growing up.  Eating the real deal after all this time, even after a great German lunch, was heaven.  It could also be because I was under-dressed for the surprisingly cold Vegas weather but the warmth of a cheese slider was bliss.  I loved every dang bite and I don't care what y'all say.We ordered a 10-slider, fries, onion rings, and two drinks combo.  We got five regular hamburgers and five cheeseburgers just to see the difference.  I was trying to tell Mike W. that cheese makes everything better but he didn't listen and I ended up having to choke down some plain burgers while he enjoyed my delicious cheeseburgers.  The fries were meh but those onion rings were pretty legit.  All in all, I wouldn't mind stopping in for a quick cheap bite when I'm on The Strip.  Is it the best burger ever?  Haha, of course not.  This is a fast food place, obvi.  But I definitely wouldn't say no to going over to White Castle for a quick bite!	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	4	2015-11-16	50	45

The sliders didn't look appetizing but tasted decent. This is definitely an establishment to visit after having a long night at the bars.Next time, I'll take advantage of the close proximity of In N Out instead. At least they have top quality burgers for a better price.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	2	2015-08-30	1	0
5	pjwzwcfBFWHQRYVwBKHzTw	cP1A1KjNkIZAPyEBWnkfpg	White Castle!!!!I was so excited to see that a White Castle had opened up in Vegas.  I have been wanting to try it ever since Harold and Kumar.  I already knew going in that I was probably not going to be blown away by White castle.  I had tried the microwavable ones and they were okay.  It is fast food and sliders, so I was not expecting gourmet or even In N Out status.  I was just excited to try it just for the sake of saying I had it before.  It is open 24 hours and located inside the Casino Royale.  We were staying at the Venetian which was just a short walk away.  The line was pretty long when we got there but it moved pretty quickly.  Their menu mostly concentrates on their sliders and they have a few slider combinations that you can get.  We decided on 10 sliders with cheese and a side of onion slices.  Each slider comes in a square box and has chopped onions and a pickle inside.  We got our order pretty quickly and headed back to the Venetian to enjoy our food.  The people working there are really nice and good natured.  They were having fun at their jobs and our cashier had a good personality.  I read a lot of people complaining about the size and relative price of the burgers.  It is a slider, that is what they are known for and it is fast food AND it is Vegas.  Everything in Vegas is like a dollar or so more in pricing when compared to another city where tourism is not so heavily relied upon.  Seriously though, lower your expectations a bit beforehand and you should be good. Despite thier small size, those things pack quite a punch because of the buns.  I got full after eating about 4 of them.  The first one I ate, I thought was really good.  The onions, cheddar cheese, soft bun and thin patty came together perfectly.  I did not even mind the pickle in there and I usually hate pickles.  I thoroughly enjoyed my first one.  By the third and fourth one, I was enjoying then less and less.  If you have had the microwavable ones, then you have pretty much tasted what they taste like.  They taste exactly like the microwavable boxed ones except just a tiny bit better.  The onion chips were really good.  I would definately recommend that if you like onions.  The breading is crunchy and thick.  We ended up having two sliders left over and I ate one at like 5 am when we got back from the club.  Still pretty good, but the bun got really hard.  I enjoyed my sliders but then again I came in with low expectations.  If you are not from the midwest or east coast and you just happen to be in Vegas, I would definately give it a shot.  It is open 24 hours anyways.  I do not think I would crave them but I would get it again if it were convenient.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	3	2015-04-06	7	3

Came on the day of Christmas and it was packed but we managed to get a table and came before the rush. Ordered the fish slider, chicken slider, and the regular beef slider. The sliders were good but the portion were so tiny compared to photos..I enjoyed it but it was gone before I knew it..took like 3 bites and it's gone. I wish the patty was slightly bigger, it was quite thin I almost missed it. The fish slider was delicious and super soft. The chicken slider was probably best out of all 3 for me. Please increase your portion!	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	3	2017-01-07	1	1
1	UtmsHIyNNgeVZlm6CYLWjA	r4wO4kez94h-dilxNMgJ6w	They are considered a east coast institution but they tasted like McDonalds Cheeseburgers to me. I think its the combination of pickles and onions and thin meat on a soft bun.Would I try again, why not but I wouldn't expect outstanding at all. Onion strips were okay. Staff was polite and kind and had me on my way with combo #2 in no time (4 cheeseburgers, onions or fries plus drink).Place is located on the east wall of the Casino Royale which I think they took some space from a Denny's that use to be there or might still be there. Security is there to keep people from cutting a very long line.My experience was walking in and was asked by a guard if I just got there, I said yes and then he asked me to get in line but there was no long line, I asked him which line? He then said oh, another guard just said go ahead sir. Line was actually 5 deep at the time and not out the door to the strip like some mentioned.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	3	2015-02-11	0	0
10	ZDEZyPUDqxO9ww4Yf7pi0g	xm66UOKtz2ve7eqvGZEgEQ	"""Charlton & the gang go to White Castle! Since this Vegas trip was primarily focused on burgers I wanted to experience as many places as possible. Ever since the movie Harold & Kumar go to White Castle popularized the existence of this burger chain to a wider audience, it has always been on the back of my mind to try it. Unfortunately since they are only located in the Midwestern United States, I had to settle on the frozen ones that they sell and love it or hate it, I find them quite tasty! Las Vegas is known for housing popular """"guilty pleasure"""" restaurants that can't be found outside of their respective regions or cities, making them must-visit destinations for tourists. Casinos have opened such iconic locations as Pink's Hot Dogs from Los Angeles in the Planet Hollywood Casino, and New York City's Shake Shack recently found a home inside the New York, New York Casino.This White Castle is located across the street from the Mirage. You can easily walk to this location by parking either at the Ceaser's Palace self parking or at any other of the casinos close by and walk to it. The location is small but there is plenty of seating available inside. Since I've had the frozen ones plenty of times before, I wanted to order the exact ones which were the cheeseburger sliders. The lowest combo you can get is 4 sliders with fries and a drink which is what I decided to get (having still been fairly full from the buffet from earlier). Once you place your order, you get a number to wait; thankfully orders are pushed out quick since they are made en masse. The sliders are all packaged individually; I can only imagine how many they go through a day. Taking my first bite, it instantly reminded me of the frozen ones. I don't know if that is a good or bad thing. The only difference was that there are pickles in the sliders that are not in the frozen ones. It does add more flavor to it but not much else. These sliders go quick, I can usually finish one in two bites or one if I really want to. The fries are crinkle cut, my personal favorite, they aren't as good as Del Taco's or Shake Shack's fries but it gets the job done. I would suggest coming here if you have NEVER eaten the frozen ones before. Then you can brag to all your friends who live out in the west or east coast saying that you've actually been to an actually White Castle. This place is worth coming for a late night snack, drunk food or a quick meal. Otherwise, if you have had the frozen ones before then you are really not missing out on anything other than the pickle. I am a fan of White Castle sliders but I'll settle for the frozen ones just fine. CC out!"""	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	4	2015-04-27	11	10

I think it hits the spot if you're drunk. And the buns are more fluffy than their frozen counterparts when fresh. So overall it's worth a go to see what Harold and Kumar were all about. Like it or hate it, it's cool that it exists on the west coast now.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	3	2015-04-15	0	1

What we ordered was the cheese burger slider which came with 4 cheeseburgers a regular fries and a drink. The sliders had pickles cheese and onions. It was soft and good. But if youre a big burger eater i suggest you order their crave packs that have 10 or more depending on how hungry you are. The buns were soft meat was soft too kinda reminds me of a meatloaf in a way but a good meatloaf lol. We also ordered the onion ring chicken slders it came two sliders regular fries and a drink. The chicken sliders were good it reminded me burger kinds chicken fries. The other stuff we ordered on the side was onion chips theyre like onion rings but turned into bite size pieces of goodness. We also had the bacon ranch fries theyre crinkled cut fries loaded with bacon ranch and cheese. It was pretty good. The other thing I ordered was a vanilla shake it was thick and yummy. Above all I would come bk the lines are long but once you order your food comes out pretty fast. They have an assembly line going on in front of you so you can see what theyre doing to your food. The best part is it's open 24 hours 7 days a week. The location is in between Venetian and Harrahs inside the Casino Royale. Oh yeah they also serve beer for all you beer lovers :-)	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	4	2015-04-02	0	0

If you look at the special """"dollar menu"""" items at rival fast food chains like McDonald's, Burger King, Carl's Jr., Jack in the Box, Wendy's etc. and take a step back and analyze how much food you get in a White Castle Burger vs a full sized burger, it doesn't add up 'tho.  It takes at least 4 White Castle Burgers to equal a standard burger (not even a Whopper or a Big Mac, Quarter Pounder, Jumbo Jack or Happy Star).So, to that degree, I think the mini-burgers are worth at most $0.50 each and ideally, not to be thrifty sounding, but in analyzing pound for pound and bang for the buck comparisons to their peers, maybe 3 for $1 or 4 for $1, so about $0.25 each (they did debut after all for $0.05, a nickle each, albeit back in the 1920's nearly a century ago.Beyond the pricing, the food was unique, it has a soft steamed bun with a pickle and chopped cooked onions with a very thin and sort of slimy (not in a bad way) square (a la Wendy's) beef patty which is reminiscent of those Banquet/Swanson's frozen dinner """"Salisbury steak"""" or sliced meatloaf.It's quite tasty and I like 'em where others may feel they're stoner late night snacks, I can see eating 'em and easily going through 4 and possibly eating 10 and maybe even being up to the challenge of over indulging to potentially eat 20... and those statements are both a testament to the fact they do taste good, but they're also not so filling and very small in size.The french fries are really weak 'tho, previously frozen crinkle cut, very thin, small portions.  I'd roll the money to be spent on fries towards other food purchases.  Del Taco uses similar styled fries, but they're much better in pricing, portions and execution (fried nice and fluffy inside and crispy outside).I rate this * * * three stars, """"A OKAY"""" which means I'd recommend it and come back again, but it's not necessarily so unique that I'd crave it and put it on my """"must go to"""" list whenever in the area, which is in part my criteria for my rankings of places that earn four or five stars.This location is on the Vegas Strip in a very safe area, easy to park if you park in a hotel casino I'm sure, congested to get to by car via the Las Vegas main strip, but convenient if you're staying in a local hotel."""	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	3	2015-10-11	5	4

Also added a 6 pc chicken rings and soda and total came out to $37!  The fries were nothing special and I won't get them again and the chicken rings were alright. Nothing special either. Burgers of course were delicious and we took half of them home and warmed the rest up for dinner. Only complaint is the prices!! They should be charging the same that they do at all there east coast locations not jacking the price up cause it's on the strip. Hope they get the jalapeño burgers soon cause those are the best!I also like to say it cracks me up how peopleCompare this to in n out!!! There is no comparison what so ever so stop comparing.

Why??Guess it's for the dudes that did not score...I grew up in the East Coast surrounded by White Castle's.Basically it's a gross hamburger that ONLY tastes great when it is between 2 AM and 5 AM and you meet ALL THREE of the following conditions:1. Your are drunk, and 2.  You are very hungry, and3.  You did not score at the club.  My friends and I would come to White Castle in HIGH SCHOOL after a night of cruising, boozing (fyi: drinking age was 18 back East--16 if you looked older and cool), schmoozing, and losing. At 2 AM all night long the place is filled with dudes that have no squeeze box--otherwise they would not be here--you have loser spelled all over you when you step foot in the door.  But after a few White Castles at 25 cents each, 30 cents with cheese it was, and some greasy ass fries--you don't worry about it till the next morning when you wake up alone with Hamburger breath. Not a place for children, not for the sober, not for anyone looking for a quality hamburger, not a place you take a significant other or any woman unless you want to get dumped fast.  I still have vivid memories of the those days back at WC. If I could only go back in time, I would not have needed to make as many trips there with the boys.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	2	2015-08-18	2	2

Cheap, hot, tasty little meat treats. The highlight was the warm juicy onions against that little crunch of pickle. The location in vegas has just missed the boat. They were tastless, over salted and soggy. I was so ticked I went to the manager and said these are not white castles. He asked me where I was from, told him, he laughed and said me too, then he went back there and made me some himself. Those tasted right. Ultimatly I think it is the fact that you have non-chicagoans trying to make vintage Chicago food. It would be like having a blind guy pick your wardrobe... he can get close because someone told him about the colors but never dead on because having never experiance them, he doesn't  really know what the colors are.

Nothing but drunk people screaming at the workers and women with barely any clothes on walking around. I really felt as if I was in a nasty club with really bad lighting. It took almost an hour to get my food, the workers looked tired, overworked, and unappreciated. I felt so bad people were yelling at them cursing them out saying mean things to them, It was really bad. On top of that, I ordered the chicken rings and try were extremely dry and hard. The shake was about 7 dollars and not great. Overall I wont be coming back, but I hope that the people that work here can get a nice vacation some day because what they go through is atrocious.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	1	2016-04-04	12	10

We stopped by after a show at the Mandalay at around 1am. Great place to go for a late late night snack....if you're wasted. This is totally drunk food. Don't come here if you're sober. The meat was thin and flavorless. It resembled Spam. Service was super quick though. Fries were the best part of the meal.

1	CQzBf4TFvxEvSsIW3Eb73A	g2msMIdgpi6OxvU8jbROpw	Oh White Castle! Even though I never watched the Harold and Kumar movie before, I have heard about the sliders from White Castle and I couldn't wait to try one. Luckily, this fast food restaurant was open 24/7 so after a night of clubbing, my friend and I headed over to this place for a quick meal. There was definitely no lines on a Tuesday morning around 4am, and I quickly ordered one original slider ($1.29) and one chicken ring slider ($1.99) to try. The cashier proudly told me he had 15 chicken rings for lunch when I seemed hesitant in trying the chicken ring slider. I was definitely not hungry enough for 15 chicken sliders, but you do you boo. However, props to the cashier working on this 4am shift! When I received my sliders, I was quite surprised at how tiny these sliders looked. They were about the size of my palms and I'm pretty sure I can eat the slider in one bite if I tried hard enough. Taste wise- they were both okay. They were not mind-blowing and I don't see myself craving these sliders in the future. They actually tasted a bit plain to me, since there was no special sauce included in the beef or chicken slider. I guess this a good place to grab a quick bite if you are on a budget since the prices were more reasonable than other restaurants on the strip. I can't say I won't ever be back, but probably not in the near future.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	3	2016-05-25	1	1

As a CA native, WC is a thing of movies and the frozen aisle at Walmart, but I needed to try the real thing. The line was short on a Sunday at 11am and my double cheese slider was ready in less than 5 minutes. IT WAS ALL I EVER HOPED AND DREAMED OF. The onion content is a bit heavier than I'd have chosen, but I'll know that for next time. Hot, moist, delicious, and satisfying. Why aren't these available closer to home?	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	5	2016-03-21	0	0

White Castle is there for you! I mean, it is what it is! If you think chicken nuggets are unnaturally shaped, get on some chicken RINGS! I cannot differentiate between regular White Castle burgers from the brick & mortar and the frozen ones. It's like they might as well have a bunch of microwaves to warm up the frozen mutant meat--no one is going to notice or care.Chicken Rings, wtf? Yes.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	4	2017-01-29	1	1
0	XS9MxXLAHJz6HWSdUfA4qA	6uA6mhXA8dCaW8_QB1TEkQ	It was husbands pick.  Heard about the lines on opening day so I was worried that it might be crowded but alas it was not at all and I can see why.  It is connected to the Casino Royale but has its own store front so you literally pass it when walking on the strip.  You can see and hear slots in the dining room.   I've tried them in the frozen aisle before and ended up tossing the rest of the box because I thought they were awful then.  I was hoping that maybe getting it fresh would make a difference.  UM, no.  They were pretty awful.  Patty is thin as paper with no flavor.  Bread is soft and soggy.  Price was also a lot for the quality you get.  $7.99 for 4 sliders, ordinary crinkle fries and a drink but it could be because they are on the strip.  Even my husband was not crazy about them either.  It was good enough to try once but I won't be coming back.  I just don't get the fascination?  Give me In and Out Burger anyday.  Heck even Burger King beats it and I can't stand Burger King.  They get an extra star for friendly staff. As for the complaint about the trays, that is the least of their problem.  The whole thing was so bland.  Would be good for kids.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	2	2015-09-04	0	0

5	q93KSB8PtxchdgcY17bH8Q	2XtRq7CFGcwsiCNSsEYtjA	I love how all of these east coast classics are making their way to Las Vegas! I guess that is the one perk about living in a city that is just one big tourist destination.White Castle made its debut a few months ago in Casino Royale, a hotel that is smashed between the Venetian and Harrah's. White Castle is really easy to find since their have their own entrance from the street. I have read the reviews about the long lines, so I waited out the hype and my first visit was last week. I was there around 4pm on a Sunday and the line was not too bad-- I would say tops, 15 minutes. We ordered four cheese sliders, a double slider, loaded fries, regular fries, cheese sticks, and drinks. The person took our order asked where we were visiting from and when replied that we lived here she offered us a 10% local discount. Sweet! You wait for your number to be called at the end of the counter. The food came out in about 5 minutes. Cheese Sliders-- They are pretty tiny, seeing how the meat in the burger is about the thickness of about 10 post it notes stacked on top of each other. But hey, they were still pretty tasty. I like the squishy buns. Ha, that sounds really weird.Fries-- Crinkle fries are better than any other fries in the whole entire world. So, I like!Loaded Fries-- Meh, could skip on these. The bacon and cheese toppings were not that special.Cheese Sticks-- I think these things could be good if there was better marinara sauce. The sauce comes in one of those sauce tubs that do not require refrigeration. It has a weird after taste. After reading all of the mixed reviews, I have to say that my visit was better than expected. A lot of people are saying that it is not like how it is on the east coast, but that's how it usually goes. The original is always better. Don't even get me started on Shake Shack LV. All of our mini sliders & fries came out to be around $20-- but that was expected, since this is the strip. The next time I want to try the cheesecake on a stick or the chicken sliders. I think I saw a sign that said that they also have a breakfast menu.Oh yeah, White Castle is open 24/7 to satisfy your after party munchies.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	4	2016-09-19	12	9
8	u_wqt9RshdZsoj8ikLqoEQ	YtAY1ZJWV9Akwi6r5p6xwg	So who was the wise guy that thought a whopping two registers was going to cut it? There's an army deep of prep workers and cooks in the back and periodically over a block long line of White Castle fans, with a team of security directing traffic and you only have TWO registers? Yeah, its awkward.O T H E R W I S E...Woohoo! White Castle is officially in Las Vegas! I can't speak on behalf of anyone else, but White Castle holds a special place in my tummy. I was born in Minnesota and still have family living there, so whenever I would visit, my uncle would welcome me to town with a crave case. What says love more than a giant box, shiny with grease, filled with sliders?Of course, this is nowhere near the top ranked best fast food burger, but it wins in the nostalgia points! Mini sliders with grilled onions - you can't go wrong there -  portable, cute, easy to eat, and especially reminds me of my childhood. Their burgers taste like how I remember it, so they don't do a bad job at this Vegas location but consistency is questionable. On our second visit my sliders were all too soggy for my liking - which is not good, not good at all.I actually prefer the original sliders over the cheese slider since the cheese overwhelms the flavor of the grilled onions too much and I love love LOVE the flavor of the grilled onions. Sometimes I would try to ask them for extra grilled onions and most of the time I am unsuccessful, but it's worth a try. We also dabbled in their cheese fries with ranch and bacon and the crew thought it was pretty tasty, but I think their crinkle cut fries need major work and typically taste stale. I really like their ranch sauce so I dip my sliders in it from time to time. Also pass on their onion chips, the batter is dense and not that great. Their shakes are simple, vanilla or chocolate - nothing crazy, but its not bad either. I don't think they offer a strawberry shake at this location since I would of been all over that. Oh yeah and they have brownies and cheesecake on a stick - just thought I'd let you know. I can typically eat 5 sliders on a good day and it is filling! For a normal person I think that 3-4 sliders is just right. For the overzealous types they also offer crave cases  and crates that range anywhere from 30-50-100! Dang. Don't come in here expecting an amazing burger - just great memories - KEEP YOUR EXPECTATIONS IN CHECK and I think you will be in a good place.RIP stomach.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	4	2015-03-03	8	8
1	qZfMILmXeiTGiZQXJ15iBw	6Yh4drGp1kw-6NzXKHW6vA	This was just freaking gros in my opinion, a couple of my friends liked it, for me the smell alone was enough for me to hurl. But as a foodie groupie such as myself lol, i don't let smell detour me its unfair. First off this place is constantly packed, fast service though. Price is a tad below average which is a small plus seeing its located on the strip. You might notice that the place is a dump in the inside, understandbly so many people. As for the burgers/sliders they were tiny and light and also tasteless nothing to write about but an after taste that stays in your mouth tasting like old onion. I went to use their toilets after waiting in line for 5 minutes, just as disgusting , it looks like the burgers rushed out of people's systems in a hurry. Save some gambling money eat somewhere better, this place is for the those in desperation to eat cheap.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	1	2015-09-10	1	0

But, I would give whom I think is the manager (we were there around 12 noon on June 1, 2015) the extra star for his skills, he was working hard along side his workers, kept his cool with his employees, and I don't know how he does it, but he even ran up to the front to call a customer back to ask if they needed condiments because he noticed that his employee forgot to ask them if they needed some.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	3	2015-07-01	0	0

That pickle they put on there is just right for the flavor.  They're nothing special though.

It was just as I remembered from the taste to the smile at the end. They are small in nature, but I don't feel like a fatty if I pound out 5 of them! I did like the fact they are put in paper containers now and the pickle in the middle gives it that perfect hint of umph when partnered with the tender meat and gooey cheese..Just thinking of the slider salivates the mouth indeed!I did take notice that the line does get a bit lengthy, but doesn't that tell you your taste in food is better than most? I thought the staff managed to kill the line pretty fast so for me waiting wasn't a complaint at all. I also found that they treat you with respect if you give it back so my experience was just as I remembered it.All in all, I will be back again and this time I just might bust for the 100 slider snack pack..Signed, sealed, and delivered their mine!	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	5	2015-05-10	0	1

Well I live in henderson for 8 years. They were in silverton casino for the food truck fair. I waited in line for over an hour. They were worth waiting for. Cost 1.00 each. Today I went to the strip to get some. Very disappointed.   The burgers were over cooked, no ketchup , no salt and the roll was like it was sitting unwrapped for hours. Dry and firm.Like a hamburger roll gets when left in sun.In NY you are able to watch them make them. Seems like they are not making them the same way.  Corporate needs to bring out someone to train them and I don't  mean a manager. There was a lady in NY that was there for over 20 years.

Don't expect anything fabulous at White Castle. Pretty disappointing. It was rather expensive for 4 sliders & fries. The bun was really airy, could have been a good or bad thing depending on how you like dem buns. The patty was a sliver. Pretty sad.The meal itself served its purpose of helping me hold my alcohol for the night soooo... 2 stars.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	2	2015-04-02	0	0

On our last night there, we took the Deuce down to Casino Royale (between Harrah's and the Venetian) to see what all the hype was all about.  I had heard the lines could get crazy, but luckily it was only minimally busy (Tuesday night) and the wait was short.  Unfortunately, I was not impressed with the hamburger.  :(   My sister-in-law tried the Chicken Ring burger and liked it, so I may consider trying that next time...  I'm glad I tried it, but not sure if I would go again.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	3	2015-02-12	0	0

My friend and I, being locals, drove from Henderson to the strip to try White Castle out. My family is from the east coast so I've experienced it before, but my friend hadn't. After our long wait, I ordered a combo with 4 sliders, a side, and a drink and I ordered the 10 slider pack to take back home to my grandma. My friend ordered 4 sliders, a side, and a drink. I received my order fairly quickly after ordering. I ate my food and waited an extra 30 minutes before my friend got his. I order 10 more sliders than he did. He went up 3 times to ask what was taking so long and the guy calling out orders said he had his ticket there and he would call him. Still nothing. He finally went and asked the cooks and they made his sliders right then and there. I don't see what the problem was. Also, two of my sliders had a pickle and two didn't. The fact that they are already inconsistent is pretty bad.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	2	2015-01-31	1	0

Oh yeah...get ready for some mean gas!  Fart game food. Most definitely a good time to play the fart game after eating at this place. Are the sliders on the east coast soggy because this place had the soggiest of the soggy.  Not a big fan. The microwave white castle burgers were way better and didn't give me the farts.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	2	2015-10-18	0	0

When I moved here 15 years ago, I called corporate and inquired about opening a franchise out here. No go, All stores are corporate owned. Bought the boxed frozen White Castle's from Smiths for years. Finally was so excited they opened a store out here. Finally made time to go and check it out. Really? The burgers here don't even compare to the frozen boxed ones, and are not even in the same ball park of the traditional ones from NY. They tasted horrible! And in NY they never had pickles on them, where did that come from? In NY we jokingly called them belly bombs, out here they truly are! My stomach hurt for 2 days after eating this crap. I am truly disappointed here and will NEVER go back to this store. The boxed ones at Smiths are WAY better and closer to the real thing you get in NY.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	1	2015-03-26	0	0

We ordered:#7 - 10 original sliders (add cheese), 2 regular soft drinks, 2 regular French fries (one of them = cheese fries).  It sounds like a lot, but for 2 really hungry people, it is a cake to finish because the sliders are small.  Each slider comes with onions & pickles (I did not realize this until I took my first bite -__-)  The food is good & it is a perfect drunk meal for when you are finished clubbing because it open 24/7!Fudge-dipped Cheesecake - Nothing extraordinary.Customer service could have been better.  Several of us were looking at the menu & deciding & the cashiers kept on asking if we were ready.  Also, considering how much food my boyfriend & I ordered, they only gave us 3 ketchups...  My boyfriend went back to ask for more & the workers gave him 2, then I went back to ask for more & I got 3.  Pretty shady!	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	3	2015-08-11	0	0

In Michigan, the current price is $4.99 for the number one. Here it's $7.99. I know it's located on the strip, but I was sooooo looking forward to coming here for an affordable meal. Also, the employees could at least smile! A smile goes a very long way! Making someone feel welcomed will keep them going back. With that and the prices I won't be in a rush to come back before I leave Vegas.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	4	2015-06-12	1	1

So whenever I went on a trip to the East Coast, I tried to make White Castle a must visit place. Unfortunately, it always eluded me, thus making the allure of White Castle that much greater. Even when it made its appearance at the food truck festivals, I opted not to wait in the 3 hour line. so when I heard they opened up a location on the strip, I figured I'd try it once and for all. And no, the Wal-Mart ones don't count. I also understand ones expectations usually does not meet their perception when yearning for so long. Plus I heard it's overrated. So when I tried it, I wasn't surprised it wouldn't live up to the hype. But what I didn't expect was for the frozen Wal-Mart ones to be better. That's right, I said it. I like my microwave sliders better. Maybe they rushed to get all orders out quickly, which is why my order felt on the cool side. i have to say though, I went on a Wednesday night and got my order quickly. So that's a plus right? So to end my review, I'll say it was ok. Worth the hype? Nah. Will I go back? Probably not. Vegas is surrounded by burger joints in the same price range. So I think I'll just check this off my list of places to try and move along.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	2	2015-04-05	0	0

The sliders were made with a thin soft bun with a small hamburger patty. I'm kind of a lettuce, tomato, and pickle on my burger gal so I found them to be plain for my taste, but not bad.

2	PcBJ693NP4UD-qmvR952zg	vri0zlcJTpZwmDHpYydaLQ	My first time ever trying White Castle was waaay back in high school straight from the frozen section. I finally got the real thing in Chicago and it was pretty damn good especially for the price. So how's this White Castle in Vegas? Nothing special sadly. There was just something missing. Not only were the prices higher here, the quality was definitely off. Where they took their time in Chicago putting these sliders together, things were rushed out of the kitchen at this location. These sliders were made with hate and you can taste it. The cheese unmelted, the burgers smashed into its containers, and the flavors sorely lacking. Where is the caramelized onion flavor white castle is known for? I thought an establishment that sold out within hours of its grand opening would present something better than cafeteria food.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	2	2016-11-25	3	1

I refused to leave the room.Then came my amazing friend with a bag full of White Castle goodies and a Serendipity float. I have the best friends in the world. I've never had White Castle before but holy moly it was PHENOMENAL. Maybe it's because I have a thing for tiny foods, but the grilled onions in these babies really make these sliders what they are.I wish I can say something about the wait or price, but I will do an update on this review when I  can.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	4	2015-07-07	0	0

This White Castle is the closest one I know where I live, but I wouldn't make the drive solely for WC. If I'm going to Vegas, I'm gambling, going to different buffets, and having my fun while I'm out here! I've came here on two separate visits to enjoy WC burgers. Cooked fresh in front of me instead of buying the WC burgers in my local supermarket freezer or convenience store.I'd imagine this WC gets a ton of foot traffic and their employees getting paid well doing what they do. Do they deserve $15/hr? Hell no! Because of what I said, there will often be long lines which doesn't bother me much. The food is well worth the wait, and if you love their food wouldn't you mind waiting a little longer? They also don't serve burgers, nope. Veggie sliders, fish sliders, etc are also on their menu. I don't come here for anything but their burgers. I mean aren't they known for their burgers? I don't mind variety and options, but In N Out has done so well just serving burgers!	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	5	2016-03-22	1	1
3	ZpBvHdJUJ4iakpQj7Ll3AQ	V3EE741pCLFrmf-5GUKytQ	This was on my list of food places I had to try when I visited Vegas. I've always been a fan of the frozen ones. I grew up eating those. When I finally visited on 12/17/16, I was sooooo disappointed. I came pretty late at night and there was a line of people. The line went by fast and I ordered the original slider, cheese slider, chicken ring slider, and the onion chips. Total came to under $20 I recall which is not bad. Food came out fast and I was ready to dig in. The sliders were about the same size as the frozen ones but it seemed a bit smaller, maybe that's just me. But as others have pointed out, these taste just like the store bought ones. Depending on you, this could be a good thing? Maybe you like the consistency? But like others, I was just expecting so much more!! I blame the hype surrounding White Castle. This place is too hyped up and I'm not sure how others could give it 3+ stars. Don't get me wrong, I'm still gonna eat my frozen White Castle sliders. But don't bother going to the actual restaurant. You'll be disappointed!Onion chips are good tho...??

0	PmrDTpSeS7NL39hBEy5sVQ	-y5A40dc-Ix6p6QoUrF78w	I've always wanted to try White Castle burgers made fresh from their actual restaurant. My experience with them to this point had been buying their frozen burgers they sell across the country in most grocery stores (which I really enjoy). I have to say that there wasn't much difference between the fresh restaurant product and the frozen product. I even think that I am slightly fonder of the frozen one. Also the added benefit of there being no drunk people stumbling around the freezer section of your local Walmart gives getting the frozen burgers a leg up on visiting this location which is in the middle of the Casino Royale (a fun but slightly shady casino on the north end of the strip). Burgers were okay, fries were okayish, and prices were average. White Castle ended up being a luke warm purgatory like experience.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	3	2016-08-28	2	5

Although it was a decent fast food option, I'm definitely glad I didn't make this place a destination on its own. $9 for a combo meal is overpriced IMO, but hey, it's on the strip, so I'm guessing the prices are a little inflated. I usually avoid this area like the plague, so I doubt I'll come again any time soon.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	3	2016-10-19	0	0

I'm going with 5 Stars due to years of memories from that extended experience. This was before things like WC fish burgers and the newest veggie option. I don't understand all the 3 Star reviews and won't even try to. All I can do is state my own opinion. Venue: Very small shop, by Las Vegas standards,  that is right off the strip and is right next to/inside of  a casino. Most easily reached by walking a distance once you find a place to park. There is no convenient parking to speak of. So I recommend combining a trip to WC with something else. Small eating area that was full because the shop was so busy.Food: The traditional White Castle menu is very simple. Onion Chips, Regular White Castle Burgers, and White Castle Cheese Burgers. But, I don't eat meat burgers anymore. So I was very interested in trying the fish burgers and veggie burgers. These are non-traditional items. I'm sure some are shocked and appalled with the concept. I was motivated to give these a try as I may not get to the midwest in the near future.Veggie Burger: Good but a great effort at providing meatless. i appreciate the effort. They provide a choice of sauces with these as they are needed. The fish burgers were a similar strong effort. Well appreciated by those on dietary restrictions. Yes,  I was a bit underwhelmed by the veggie burgers but the chance to indulge myself in old memories was priceless. I'm glad I made the effort to seek out this White Castle experience.Service: 5 Star Service from a very busy crew.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	5	2016-10-05	3	1

Though I was never a fan of the frozen White Castle sandwich I still wanted to try this one.The line was super long when we got there, and waited at least 30mins in line. We ordered two of the Cheese Sliders Combo, which came with 3 cheese sliders, fries and a drink. I wasnt really expecting too much thinking it will taste exactly like the frozen ones, but I thought they were pretty good! I wouldnt say that im obsess with it tho, lol. I would still recommend it if you're in Vegas just to say that you've tried it. Lol.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	4	2016-10-21	1	1

0	hvZlL2KogIcBfYmmXS18CQ	iv5Xp48dDWISd62Fuftr3A	I really didn't think the sliders were that good here. It seems all hype and its so busy since it's usually on the East Coast and this is the closest location to me (I'm from CA). I don't know if it's worth coming here and looking for this if you're on the strip like we did... The sliders and chicken rings tasted microwaveable and the French fries tasted old and weren't crunchy. My friend also said it tasted just like the ones you can get at the store. The sliders are so small too and they only have a thin piece of meat, cheese, onions and a pickle--not what I was expecting. #2-- 4 cheese sliders, a small fry and a soft drink were not worth $9.27. Good thing I split it with a friend and we got more food after! I'm sorry White Castle... I'm not sure if I'll be back. :(	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	2	2015-06-23	1	1

There's about 20 employees behind the counter together yet maybe only five or so are actually working.

The way its cooked makes it a little soft, but i really liked it. It's different from all the other fast food places here. The fries are nothing special (just not my thing) but they did have the bonus of reminding me of my childhood. My suggestion would be to get the loaded fries.Can't wait to go back and try more!

Spent almost $50 and could have done way better with $15 at dell taco.The best part of this experience was the smoke drenched casino attached and the jameson filled Irish coffee you can get while waiting 30min to get inside.

1	VehPPTKsJ4dwmHZj94duMA	naq1RWW7eg5IX4zqRm4Wlg	White Castle. I'm from the east coast, so I've had WC before, and I was pretty excited they were opening on the strip. I found myself on the strip at 5:45 am, less than 16 hours after the grand opening and judging by the line I figured this may be my only shot to ever eat here. Even at 6 am it was pretty packed. I only ordered 2 sliders and onion chips and waited for my food. And waited for my food. And...See, the issue is, there's always going to be some yahoos getting a crave case or a crave crate (100) that is going to hold up the line. I also saw people getting their food before me that ordered after me, and my order was quite small. Pros: It tastes exactly like the White Castle you have grown to love. Cons:The price is a bit higher than your typical standalone WC. The wait is always going to be outrageous. The back of the house is absolutely filthy. Like, worse than Waffle House. If you've got the time, and you want some White Castle, have at it. I'm not sure I'll be back. Three *** - Only because I knew what I was getting into.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	3	2015-01-28	6	1

It was nice to finally try White Castle, since there are none near me.  The burgers are pretty small.  I liked how the burger bun was really soft.   We also ordered the fries, which are crinkle cut.

But for me, it was worth it every one bit. I ordered one of every type of burger. The double burger with jalapeno cheese was my favorite--so melty, so soft, so delicious and perfect. I literally could have finished it in a bite. Burgers were not greasy one bit. We tried the onion chips as a side since they seemed to be the most unique. I could have done without them, but they were a nice accompaniment. I love watching the employees make the little burgers. So efficient and coordinated. It's gross looking at the raw little patties (I mean, who knows what's in that meat despite them emphasizing it's 100% beef) but still, it was delicious.

Was looking forward to this Whitecastle as I had eaten the sliders from the frozen food aisle in the grocery store when I was a teenager. I guess it would be different if I grew up with them and it was nostalgic, but I didn't and they're just gross and $1.59 per slider with cheese... Ridiculous!  Excellent customer service, though...nice people!	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	1	2015-06-27	0	0

Came here with high expectations due to: 1) Everyone ranting and raving about how great the burgers are2) It's renowned reputation in the East Coast3) they made a movie about how amazing it is! Always wanted to try it after watching Harold and Kumar so naturally when I had a chance to dig into a pack of these """"amazing burgers"""" during my last trip to Vegas, how could I not??? Although the service was great, the staff worked hard & fast, and the restaurant was constantly being cleaned (thus the 3 stars), the burgers were just OK and left something to be desired. They were mini burgers with paper thin meat that you could hardly taste and bread that was somewhat soggy due to the pickles/onions. it was a huge let down when I took my first bite. I immediately regretted being overly excited and buying a whole pack of these mediocre burgers! My husband and I didn't get through our pack of burgers and ended up throwing them away knowing we weren't going to eat them later. Huge disappointment!  :("""	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	3	2015-10-23	0	0

My little itty bitty teenie weenie, did I mention teenie weenie, oh yea I did, super micro thin patty was a sight to behold if I could find the darn thing! I have never experienced a meat slider so tiny before. The flavor was very meh and it was just very lack luster. The onion finger thingy's were good, they tasted like a crispy onion ring. The fries were the average crinkle frozen fries so party there. Overall, I didn't like it enough to eat there again. On to the next spot!	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	2	2017-05-06	3	2

My favorite was the onion chips, but I'm a big fan of deep fried, battered onions. I liked the fish burger, but I wish they put sauce on it. The chicken breast burger was just OK but also needed some sauce & seasoning. Last, I got the cheeseburger. It was OK and had too much filler in it that it didn't taste like hamburger meat. Also, it was pretty bland. I liked the soft buns on everything, but it's not enough to bring me back. For tiny sandwiches, it ended being pretty pricey. Service was good.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	3	2016-05-29	0	0

5	zBi_JWB5uUdVuz3JLoAxGQ	rT3lGuWhX5vy8oizMpFwTg	Mmmm White Castle...brings me back to my college days every time I visit one! I was stoked when I heard they were opening a WC in Vegas because that means I no longer have to seek them out when traveling back to the Midwest. I knew the crowds would be bad so I waited a couple weeks before checking it out. But little did I know there would still be crowds and long lines! If you come to this location, expect to wait in 2 separate lines: 1 outside to get into the store and another to order once you get inside. The security guards were a little rude during this whole process, which may turn me off from this location for a while, at least until the lines die down a little.This location is also much more expensive than other WC locations I've been to...probably because it's located on the Las Vegas Strip versus some southside hood. The food is on par with any other WC's and is something people either love or hate. You'll never meet someone that just thinks White Castle is alright. They will either love it or hate it and this one is no exception. My favorites here are the cheeseburger sliders and chicken rings. Their fries suck so I would stay away from those. I thought maybe this location would be different because it would be fresher due to higher turnover from the crowds but nope...still sucks! They had a full staff working and the food comes out surprisingly fast for the amount of customers they're serving. Like all their locations, this one is 24/7 so you can get your fix anytime!	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	3	2015-02-13	8	4

This is my first time trying White Castle and I really wanted to see what the hype was all about, but I was so disappointed. The beef patty is so thin you are basically eating steamed buns with pickles and cheese. The onion fries I got tasted how I expected it to taste, basically cut up onion rings. Glad I finally got to try this after so many years, but basically one and done for me.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	3	2015-04-28	1	0

I wasn't expecting the soggy/steamy taste but it was surprisingly good. The area seems a bit sketch and the casino nearby looks a bit run down, but the food was good so I can't complain. I also don't see much crinkle fries around and this place had them! I ended going back the next day to get more of those delicious square burgers.

0	13L_l5JE_tYqt4UpmCNm1g	bLiqh4PgkxtrOTYoY850Kg	Every time I see this place, I think about Harold & Kumar go to White Castle.Although I've seen and passed by this place every year for the past several years, I finally decided to come in and try the place in February.I actually walked from The Excalibur here and walked back. In a way, it was my own White Castle adventure.I was able to snag a coupon from a guy about a block down and that really sealed the deal.The restaurant was pretty packed, there were absolutely no seats available, but the line was very short when I got in. I got the 4pk cheese sliders with a drink and fries for about 9 bucks before the coupon. I was kind of expecting the prices I heard in the movie, but I'm thinking since this is Vegas and on the strip, everything is like 50-100% more.Food came out within about 5mins, and I took it to go and ate at the fountain right in front of In N Out.If you ask why I didn't just go to In N' Out, it's because I have one close to home, so I wanted something I can't get back home.The burgers themselves actually didn't look very appealing. The meat kind of looks like spam (not that I have anything against spam). I have had the frozen ones before and those looked better.As for the taste, it wasn't bad. Typical fast-food burger taste, but the little chopped grilled onions add a lot of flavor. I was pretty full after eating all 4 of the sliders.I would probably come back again if I had a longer stay in Vegas. If I'm only here just a few days, I would probably rather have something a bit nicer.The only exception is that my brother is pretty crazy about these, so if he ever comes along on one of my trips to Vegas, I'll bring him here so he can try to eat 20 of these lol.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	3	2017-06-05	0	0
10	AN9y_ctlxODtNOhwk2mx-Q	o4m5pSc6I0-hEhBGqu9o3w	Came here for an early lunch. I think it was 10:30 am when we got here. This White Castle is located on the strip near Venetian hotel and casino. Hubby wanted to come here. I was not impressed but super hungry. I got a number 2 which consisted of 4 small White Castle cheeseburgers with crinkle cut fries and a drink. I enjoyed the crinkle cut fries. I had a raspberry iced tea. The burgers were filled with cheese and pickles. I don't like pickles in our burgers. I think this place gets too much hype. Place had refill Coke soda station like the old school fountains. Descent place to eat. The guy at the register was super nice. The guy calls your number when your food is ready. You basically dump your own trash. There is plenty of seating. At least I got to try this place once.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	3	2016-02-16	16	15
1	QaOtVVgxD5GYyE9ALuKNQA	W2nvhL7cL8awH-nz1vIw2g	I don't know what to say about White Castle sliders...Realistically speaking, there shouldn't be any reason why a slider from White Castle should be appealing: (1) cheap, soft, over processed rolls which are reminiscent of what you can expect from the buffet at Pondegrossa, (2) over-cooked, greasy patty cut in a ridiculous, bite-sized 2x2 inch square, (3) a diced and sliced mixture of onions and pickles that are better suited for a hot dog or a stupid, McDonald's hamburger......And yet, they're surprisingly good.  They have the faintest philly cheesesteak aspect to them that I find irresistible.  And unlike a cheesesteak, which has sliced rib eye steak, a White Castle slider can't be nearly as expensive to replicate that flavor.  I'd say they're on to something, but then again they've been doing this for a while.  After all, some movie director even made a movie with the White Castle name on it which forever immortalized it in the bong-resin charred brains of stoners everywhere.As far as I'm concerned, I only seem to dip into a White Castle every decade or so, but I was pleased to see that they have all kinds of different sliders these days: chicken sliders, jalapeno sliders, fish sliders, etc.    Maybe next time I'll get a double cheese slider and a bacon & cheddar grilled chicken slider.  Who knows?  It might get really weird.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	3	2015-05-13	1	0

So when we saw they had a location to try on the strip I was interested in trying them. Well the taste is no better then what you would get from the grocery store, so might as well stick with that if they are the same plus you don't have to wait in long lines like you do at this place. On the bright side they are pretty inexpensive compared to the other food choices offered on the strip.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	2	2016-01-17	1	1

I was also curious what else White Castle had to offer other than the obvious. I had chicken rings which were basically like chicken nuggets with a hole in the middle. The burgers tasted pretty close to the flavor I've experienced with the frozen kind. I don't know if that speaks to White Castle's ability to freeze and recreate in the microwave or what. It's okay. Wouldn't make the trip to this part of the strip specifically for White Castle but wouldn't object if I was part of a group who all wanted to eat there.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	3	2015-10-08	0	0

The burger itself isn't anything special and clearly it has to be a nostalgic thing for you to actually enjoy eating them (how brainwashed are you Midwestern people?). That being said my pregnant self wanted a slider for a snack at 10 AM and this place delivered. There was no wait at 10:00 AM (surprise surprise) and the food was cheap (for the strip) and came out very quickly (maybe 3 mintues?). The place was clean, not overly crowded and a nice fast snack option for when you're roaming the strip.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	3	2015-02-25	0	0

Whether it is the frozen ones at Smiths in the frozen food section or sliders from other restaurants, the actual sliders I had here at this location was mediocre at best if I was I really hungry.Im trying to understand how east coast  peeps grew up on this garbage. This is definitely one of those spots that are severely hyped up because of the fact that this is the only White Castle closest to the west coast. The funny thing is that the first day they opened, they ran out of food! What a fail on their part. You're open 24 hours. You know you're gonna have patrons lined up for miles but yet you just happen to run out of product. I knew eventually I had to try it just to see what the hype was. I have only tried the frozen ones so far. So a couple of my friends are here from out of town. Of course they want to try it. So off we went.Located just inside the Casino Royale just right off the strip, you line up starting outside if it is really busy. One thing is for sure, I dont think this casino has never seen so many people in their establishment. Since it is a part of the casino, you will be exposed to the smoke factor. You cant smoke where you can sit down and eat your burger but yet you will be inhaling enough of it coming from the casino itself. They have security posted outside where the line begins and one right at the door where you enter.So far I have gone 4 paragraphs without any mention of what we ordered. That just shows you how really bad the food is. While my wife went and stayed in line to order food, I scoped out a table. She came back with two craver packs for our group along with loaded fries and 4 drinks. The total came out to 51 bucks and some change. I was somewhat hungry so I ate 2 regular sliders with cheese. In the other craver pack I also ate 2 regular sliders with pepper jack cheese. Now I LOVE onions but the ones they put in these sliders taste like reconstituted onions. You know, the dry kind that has to be mixed with water to bring it back to life. Then they grill it. The smell of it now that I think about it almost makes me want to vomit. The patty itself does not look like a real beef patty. Referring to my pic, it looks more like prop comparable to those fake plastic fruits you will see in some people's homes. The only thing that may have peaked my interest was the pepper jack cheese. Had a little kick to it. As for the loaded fries, I was no longer in the mood to eat after surprisingly eating 4 sliders.Service was actually decent, otherwise this would be a 1 star review. From standing outside to making it in to order, all took a total of about 25 minutes with 10 waiting for our finished product after ordering. They have one security guard outside to watch the line while another one is at the door entrance to make sure nobody cuts. This was surprisingly organized. Too bad that's it. Oh and that they are open 24 hours would be the other thing.In closing, if you have never been here, by all means, try it out so you can make up your own mind if its worthy of a trip to the Casino Royale. I mean, you don't really hear too many people talk about going to the strip just to go to a not too well known casino.

Given that I was starving and have heard such great things about this place I was very excited.Little did I know this place is literally the worst burger joint I have ever gone too.

I had to choke, literally choke down my sliders, then was nauseous the rest of the evening. Buns, were soggy, meat tasted old. Fries were of the frozen variety, not evenly cooked or seasoned. We paid roughly $10 for the #2 and shared it.. let's just say I can get a steak and lobster for that price in town and not be sick or disappointed. We can say we've  scratched it off of our bucket list, but will not be back.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	1	2015-09-14	0	0

I had to try it because of the movie and I'm from the west coast so this was my chance but it was a lesson learned. Never coming back. Flavorless. Worst fries ever. Mystery meat?

It is Las Veags, and it is a bit pricey,  but for any true sliders fan;  they know these are the best little burgers. The flavor is amazing and the softness of the bread is excellent. I love how they cook the sliders over a bed of steamed onions. Nothing has changed here since I first had one as a little kid. If you did not grow up on these sliders than you missed out. I love White Castle. Finally the west coast is catching up.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	5	2015-07-10	0	0
2	swM1TW_7mrPk6UJnTa4SNw	LvEGicfJu29om_9d40Mq8A	For over 30 years I've been hearing about White Castle sliders from those that lived in, or traveled to parts of the country that offered them. Then, after Harold and Kumar made their movie, I truly hoped that one day I would travel to a place in the mid west or eastern parts that had a White Castle Burger joint, or even better, I wished that White Castle would open a store here in Southern California. Sadly, no luck either way. Then voila! I saw them in the frozen section of my local super market. I bought a pack, took them home and immediately nuked a few in the microwave. Not bad I thought to myself. They had a unique flavor with kind of an onion tang. Nevertheless, these were frozen burgers. I knew the freshly made ones had to be better, so I withheld final judgement, and continued to hope for a real experience at a White Castle location.Fast forward several years and I'm walking the strip in Las Vegas and the White Castle sign hit my like a ton of bricks! There it  was! Boom! A real deal White Castle burger joint right here in Las Vegas, and right in front of me! I dragged the wife into the place and immediately placed an order for sliders, fries and a drink. So let me get this out of the way first, I don't like krinkle fries. And, the White Castle krinkle fries were no different than any other krinkle fries I've tried. So what did I think of the sliders? They were really tasty and much better than the frozen ones, as I expected them to be. These are truly unique sliders. They are steamed with the onion on the patties. I think that's part of what makes them distinctive.Now, if I'm only judging the slider, in the context of the fast food world of large or popular burger chains, I give it 5 stars considering the under $2 price. I don't smoke weed, but if I did, I could see myself eating a bag of these little morsels after smoking a bowl, just like Harold and Kumar did in the movie. The slider is the only thing that stood out. Again, I didn't care for the fries, and everything else was just okay. Service was decent, drink fountain was nothing special. Over all, 4 stars for White Castle, mostly because of their famous sliders.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	4	2017-03-15	1	2
7	BCAr4PSRSvAC_Ev7FLUlyg	wcljx7MelKn4INEwcn9SqA	What's all the hype???? I will never understand. Upon arrival to Vegas, two of my friends were so excited about this place, so we ended up going here on our second day for a late lunch. I ordered a regular combo that came with 4 burgers, fries and a drink. They were so unorganized that I ended up with someone else's food, but after standing there for 8 mins I decided to just roll with it. I actually ended up with some little tasty onion crispers instead of fries. Now, I will say that I liked them a lot, but the burgers were exactly like a Krystal burger ( no biggie, nothing major ), it looked like a Krystal & tasted like a Krystal. I later had a tummy ache. There restaurant set up is wide open, so you can see everything going in the kitchen area.  The restaurant dining area was a complete mess, I mean,  if you know you have that much traffic coming thru your restaurant, one would think you would have a clean up staff on duty at all times. I wasn't impressed, once was enough for me.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	2	2015-06-24	14	7
0	_UZcVKX9K9ujq93sIVFDVw	HXaFETDCxGGUefLQWOUPhA	This probably deserves a 4-star rating given most people's expectations, so let me clarify before I get into the review: I have no real qualms about this place besides the price. The burgers are nearly as good as those in the Midwest.So, the GOOD:- Burgers are nearly as good as the Midwest- They give you as many ketchup packets as you want (you probably need to ask if you want any at all)- The place seemed clean enough during a busy night around 1 in the morning- The wait wasn't bad, for the ordering line or for the pickup lineThe BAD:- The main thing is the price. It shouldn't be more than a dollar per burger, and obviously buying more burgers should give you some sort of deal. But it's (as of April 2016) $35.99 for a crave case (30 plain sliders), which is almost the exact same price as 30 individual sliders. Likewise, it costs 30 cents to add cheese to a slider. If you add cheese to all 30 sliders, you might expect some deal. Nope. 30 cents times 30 slices of cheese is 9 dollars, which is the exact amount you'll have to add to your price if you want 30 sliders with cheese instead of regular sliders. That means you're paying $44.99 for 30 tiny sliders...and that's before taxes.Look, I know it's the Vegas strip, so I don't really mind the price that much. Everything's more expensive, and the constant stream of customers proves they're asking a fair market price. Still, I'm taking away a star because that's just way too much money for those tiny burgers. It costs the same amount for 30 tiny sliders as for like 30 full size McDoubles.- The burgers aren't quite as good as in the Midwest. They're still good -- they'll satisfy if you're a White Castle fan like myself -- but they're just slightly lacking. I think the problem is that they use this large island grill where something like 4 people work at once, and that open setup results in the steam escaping. For those who don't know, part of the magic of White Castle is that the burgers are cooked by steaming them over a bed of onions. So that onion flavor permeates the entire burger and bun. But with the Vegas location setup, I think the steam doesn't do it's job. Which also results in less moist buns.But don't let this sway you from going here. Still very good.- The staff wasn't all that friendly. Not that they were rude. When I asked for ketchup, the guy gave me plenty of ketchup, but didn't even look at me as he was serving me. The people on the grill looked a bit miserable. That's understandable, given they probably spend their day making millions of sliders non-stop because this is a hugely busy location. The girl taking orders was neither friendly nor unfriendly.- The menu is a bit poorly done. The cheese options, for instance, are listed as a footnote at the top (are those still called footnotes?) where it mentions that you can add cheese or jalapeno cheese. For those unfamiliar with the White Castle menu, they'll probably just miss that option entirely.- It's WAY at the end of the strip (that is, the part furthest from the 15 freeway). Not as far as Trump Hotel, but past the Venetian. So if you're down near Excalibur, or even the Cosmopolitan, you've got a long walk ahead of you. Might be better to drive to closer hotel and walk. Harrah's parking is free and easy to access off the strip (not sure about other hotels -- do your own research).SUMMARY:Go here. It's good.So why the low rating? I'm taking off two stars because of 1) price and 2) not having the service or taste that lives up to the Midwest experience. But it's still quite good -- I just can't justify mathematically giving it 5 stars because 5 stars would be the standard White Castle experience, which this misses. But going here was still awesome.PRO TIP: White Castles are excellent breakfast food. Let them sit overnight -- keep the burger cases overlapping to trap the moisture in! -- then let them sit out overnight and enjoy the next day.Always consume with ketchup.HELPFUL INFO for the uninitiated:White Castle sliders are tiny and come standard with chopped, slightly grilled onion, and a pickle. No mustard or ketchup. You have to ask for ketchup packets if you want, but it's easier to bring your own bottle so you don't spend your meal opening and squeezing out 30 packets.For guys with a young appetite, you could easily consume 10 sliders. Something like 6 might be enough for you.Women and girls with lesser appetites might be satisfied with 2-4 sliders.Don't forget to try out their other stuff, like jalapeno cheese, onion rings, etc. It's all good stuff.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	3	2016-04-01	1	1

I never make it to the east coast and now that there is one in Vegas, I had to try it. So far I've only had the frozen ones which are just """"ok"""". Well unfortunately it tasted the same as frozen. Guess that says how good of a job they did with the frozen burgers, but also about how """"meh"""" the burger is. I'd imagine the prices are a lot higher at the Vegas location than ones on the east coast, at least I hope so for there sake. They had combos with 2 or 3 sliders and the things are so tiny I wouldn't be surprised if people easily take down 10. I got a single, a double, then split some onion rings (although they werent rings, what? they qere quarters) and chicken rings (which actually were rings). There is way better food on the strip, especially for burgers, but if you go here, I suggest just trying it for a drunking snack, not for a real meal."""	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	3	2015-04-03	0	0

But when we got there it was met with disappointment! The burgers tasted exactly like they came out of the frozen food section. I mean if that's how it's suppose to taste, that's fine but I was disappointed. It was nice to finally eat at this world famous joint but wasn't impressed. The chicken rings and onion chips were pretty good and that's why it's an average (3 star) rating. The wait was nonexistent. We walked right in and ordered (we went in on a Wednesday around 11am). We found it easiest to get there by parking at the Venetian and walking towards the strip and hanging a left.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	3	2015-03-23	0	0

That's amazing for a Grand Opening first day.White Castle is now open on the Las Vegas Strip, across from The Mirage and inside of the Casino Royale. They serve beer via those cool stadium bottom up cups. The sliders are small, so be sure to order more than a few at a time.Their drink stations easily accommodated all of the people on opening day, so they should be good to go from now on. I like their fudge covered cheesecake bite on a stick for dessert.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	5	2015-01-27	10	4

The manager at the location took the time to explain how they grill their burgers and said that they could make their sliders with no buns. They even cleaned the grill before they made them and kept them separate from all of the other burgers. The taste of the burger was amazing for fast food. They were a little pricey, but the flavor of the food made up for the price. I would definitely recommend going here if you are looking for a quick and delicious night night snack!	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	4	2015-06-04	0	0

2	s7x1L6a7OXr-g0IazyQIzA	N6a3untNvHdnm2AEKSyahw	Being a self proclaimed burger expert I had been waiting to come here for ages. Last time I came to Vegas I didn't find out there was a white castle here till I had left. This time however I made a point to come here. Now I've been eating quality burgers my whole life and yes I can be a little critical at times. However when I came to white castle in Vegas I was in a very vulnerable position. I was extremely hungover, even a big Mac would have made me happier than anyone could imagine.So I naturally got in line and asked what I should order since it was my first time at white castle. I got a very vague response that the beef was good and that the chicken was good as well. With this information I order 4 beef sliders, 2 chicken sliders, fries and a drink for a total of around $17. I got the food a short time later and was very unimpressed. For $17 back in Cali I can get some very quality burgers and great service from a well known restaurant that has locations all along the west coast, Nevada, and Texas. These burgers were very bland and tasteless. I tried using the sauces provided and they didn't really help very much at all. The food just lacked any kick or flavor. It tasted like something that was pulled out of the frozen food section, microwaved and then given to me. If anyone from Cali is reading this, we aren't missing out on anything by not having white castle. The east coast however y'all definitely missing out on not having in n out.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	2	2016-06-06	1	0

I never wanted to settle for the frozen stuff because I wanted to try the real thing, or at least as close as I could to the real thing which was the location in Vegas.I love sliders. If sliders are on the menu, I'm 110% all about sliders. They're just really delicious, bite-sized, soft and convenient little burgers. My girlfriend thought they were okay and tasted just like the frozen ones, but every bite was extremely satisfying.It ended tragically though.

First time I came here after about 10 years since I've watch the movie so I was extremely excited. This place is extremely busy and honestly the food here is mediocre. This is good quick drunk munchie type of food, but not worth the price.I ordered the two cheeseburgers with chicken rings and the total was about $10. It is very expensive for very little food. The thing that really bothered me was one of the rude worker. After waiting for about 15 minutes to get my food, I asked the lady what type of condiments that they served here because it was my first time here. Her response was, 'well condiment do you want.' So I replied with what are your options. She was just rude about it and for some reason wouldn't tell me. I got frustrated so I just told her to tell me the ones they have so I can choose and if you can't do that then I want one of every condiment there is to offer. She finally told me and I got what I wanted, but all this altercation was very unnecessary. This place is pricy, has little food for what you pay for, busy, and has rude workers. No reason to ever come back here again or ever recommend people to come here.

And if Harold and Kumar is your only refereence to these little angels, thats sad.Much like most of the places on this strip, WC is always packed, but the staff is unfazed! The drunks, the Half Naked, the Regular Folks like me are all treated to the same great service and regular 15-30 minute wait on a good day (first visit was like an hour but since I didn't have any heart transplants to preform or any nations to conquer, i waited. That's the reason I came that day!) Because it's SO busy, you never have to worry about any food that's cold. The grill is ALWAYS going! The cost is the only thing I'm not liking. Seems about $4.00 more expensive than its Midwestern siblings for the same meal, but hey, it is Vegas.

The closest thing to these little sliders in SoCal are in the frozen foods aisle of the grocery store.I got loaded fries and a slider. 1 slider because I didn't know if they were going to be giant sliders or tiny ones. The fries were crispy and definitely loaded. The slider was good but not enough so I got another one. They're like the size of a post-it.If you're comparing White Castle sliders to premium hamburgers then that's not a fair fight, White Castle goes into a category all on its own of fast food sliders. The employees are all really friendly. The food is good and soaks up all the alcohol you've been drinking.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	4	2015-12-16	10	8

Plus we ate at Andre's the night before, so wth.I'll admit that my nice experience was probably due to the fact that we were staying on the strip (so no need to drive and park), our wait on a Saturday night on a holiday weekend was less than half an hour, we met some cool people in line, and we found these two private seats over in a corner with a floor to ceiling window.We got a ten pack plus loaded fries and a soda which really isn't much for two people.  But then again, what's the point of getting sliders if you're just going to eat 20 by yourself?  Go get In N Out instead.  I actually enjoyed the food, although I'll always prefer In N Out.  I can see why people say that you either need to grow up on it or be stoned to enjoy it.  We downed a few drinks beforehand, but I think I would still enjoy the food sober.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	4	2015-02-18	0	0

It's tasty. It's a novelty. Go for the experience. Try the onion strips. Mmmm.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	4	2017-07-21	0	0

You can actually buy the 6 pack White Castle frozen burgers at Target, Safeway, and Walmart, which are very tasty if you microwave them properly!  The only difference from the real deal is they don't have pickles on them, yet taste almost exactly the same as eating in person at the restaurant!On my recent visit to Las Vegas, White Castle was #1 on my list of tourist things to eat!!!  My brother has been to the ones on the East coast, so he told me they opened up the very first West coast WC on the Las Vegas strip a couple months ago.  To my surprise, it was just across the street from our hotel :DI was very happy to discover that White Castle is open 24/7.   My first visit, was in the late afternoon, loooong lines, a bunch of loud drunk people, no where to sit, and crazy busy wait.   We opted to eat a quick snack instead at the little Footlong Hot dog place in Casino Royale, and came back next day 10am!!!  NO LINES and NOT crazy busy lol.  Definitely had to try the Double cheeseburgers, Onion strips and of course the crinkle fries.   I loved everything, Double cheeseburger was great, comes with the tiny onions and pickles, crinkle fries were great, and Onion strips were good.  I really didn't mind the prices, for my first visit, it was worth it.   I just want to say if you are a big eater, make sure you get yourself at least 4-6 cheeseburgers because they are tiny and won't fill you up compared to regular cheeseburgers elsewhere.  I think White Castle is more like a snack for some people...Staff was very friendly and helpful, place was clean too!  I am really glad I had the opportunity to come here and try it out for myself.  It really was more about the experience and enjoying my vacation in Las Vegas.  Next time I come back, I'll try the chicken rings and loaded fries.   Menu is simple and easy to order from, and for drinks they have a fountain soda machine.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	4	2015-04-20	7	7

I live in Los Angeles now and when  go back to visit family in NY, I usually grab a few White Castle in The Bronx and get that great White Castle taste I grew up with.Last week I went to this Las Vegas location and I'm sad to say I was disappointed in the food.  First of all, $3.59 for a double burger is just way over priced!  The White Castle locations I visit in NYC charge about $1.89 for a double.  I guess it being located on the strip is why the high cost?  I did notice the menu was a little different.  I don't think I saw fish sandwiches and I didn't see any fried clam strips.  And I'm fine with those menu differences.  I did like the onion sticks instead of the usual onion rings.  My biggest issue was the flavor of the burgers.  They just don't taste as good as the White Castle I'm used to.  Despite them being made fresh at this location, they still taste similar to those terrible frozen ones you buy at the supermarket.   It's too bad because I was really excited to have a location out west.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	2	2016-11-11	2	0

Not only was I here for Shake Shack (my most favorite NY burger spot and the place I've been talking about for the past two and half years). So, after clubbing at Hakkasan, we went to get grub and feast on 30 burgers and two fries! Coming from a person who has never had White Castle, I loved it! The chicken rings burger was amazing too! After eating these, I wanted more and more the very next hour. Overall, spent $46 bucks on the food for two!

Unfortunately, living in Northern California, I've never been able to try it until now. These burgers were some of the best I've ever had.

I usually stick to eating at gourmet burger joints, rather than getting the fast food type, however in Vegas I had the chance to visit White Castle, a place I've always wanted to try after watching the Harold and Kumar movies.. I was very shocked at the standard of meat being used in the burgers.. it looked inedible and made me want to feel sick at the site of it.. The cheese and onions being used looked burnt and plastic looking.. There was no sauces etc inside the burger it was plain and stale... The prices are cheap, however I feel this place is more for those who are heavily drunk or intoxicated by other means... I would never try White Castle again... I'm shocked this place hasn't been shut down.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	1	2017-04-03	0	0

Soft warm buns, grilled diced onions, pickles and cheese... Melts in your mouth as soon as you bite into it... I like adding a little ketchup and mustard. I get full from eating four of them...

For those of you who don't know, the west coast remains White Castle-less and i'm glad that it remains that way.  Unless, you've had one too many cocktails or a yard of a margarita in need of say (1-100 burgers) to satisfy your hangover needs. It tastes just like the ones available at your local Vons/Safeway Freezer section. Save your money for other delicious foods in Vegas.While i'm sure many people dream of pursuing a """"Harold and Kumar"""" type of adventure (especially because its in Vegas. So why not?)

But when I got to WC the line, well people are so excited about it right now -- the line was down the street at least 45 minute wait a worker told me at the door so, I snapped these pics and left.

We placed our order at the cashier and then head to the soda fountain to fill up our drinks. Before we are finished filling up our drinks, the man (5'8-5'10 with short hair) at the front counter is already calling out our number to pick up our order. I'm already trying my best and hurried up filling up our drinks so I can pick up the order. But within seconds after the first number call, the man at the front counter started to sound impatient and angry when he calls (yelling and screaming) out our number for the second and third time. I'm appreciative that they provide fast service on the orders, but the man really scared us and made us feel forced/rushed, it was very unprofessional!Note (02/26/2015): This location barely just opened and it's the first location on the west coast, it's already at 2.5 star overall rating on Yelp, it's shameful and embarrassing.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	2	2015-02-09	1	0

My group and myself felt so ill and bloated afterwards that we would all rather regurgitate the food than continue to walk around the strip with it in our stomachs. These sliders were soggy and terribly put together. The sliders you get back in middle school that were in a bag were way better than this. My fries either had the flu or were just old because they were pale and felt like rubber. If you are sober and looking for a decent meal to eat so that you can sight see, DO NOT EAT HERE!

1	Wp4kJtlXC3ap7X0FA_0dAg	siq3ROaZ6HN-zPFfKGHN5g	Pretty disappointing especially since it got so much hype from Harold and Kumar, but I had to try it when I saw that they had a location in Vegas.You can buy sliders individually without a combo meal or without getting a 10 pack. I ordered 1 slider (just to try it) and the 9 piece chicken rings. Slider was about $1.29 each (which I'm told is more expensive than their usual locations, probably because it's Vegas).Super disappointed. The whole slider can probably be ate in 1 bite and it just melts in your mouth in a bad way. You dont even need to chew. I'm all for soft buns, like shake shack buns, but this reminded me of wonder bread, which is probably as artificial as it gets... There's also little to no patty. Chicken rings were basically flattened out pieces of chicken cut into being shapes. They were like onion rings. You also have to ask them for ketchup.Yeah, its probably the cheapest you can get in Vegas, but its also just low quality food that you should probably just skip. Only good thing is that you get your food fast after you order.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	1	2015-03-24	1	1

0	eguB3eXzLRK3h40Oi0Iw3g	CcnxlklXtP3YB5WmorxO7w	I give them 3 stars because the food is to my liking; however, there are a few things that I don't like about this place...1). You have to park at a hotel and walk through the casino to get out to the strip to do some more walking just to get to the place. (walking I don't mind so much, good exercise - trying to keep a positive mindset especially if you're eating junk food lol)2). When you do finally get there, you have to wait in line and depending on when the tables are cleared/available and how many people you have with you (besides how packed they are) will determine how long you wait until you get inside - only to have to wait in another line to order your food.3). They dont have an extras section on the menu - for example if you want to add an extra slider to your combo. 4). If you're sitting by the door of the entrance to the place, during the Volcano show at the Mirage hotel across the street, you can feel the heat blowing at you when the door is open. (Im not a fan of heat; and yes Im aware I live in Vegas lol)***Lastly, I hope they open more locations so for some of us locals who tend to avoid the strip wont have to go to there. As good as the food was, the traffic on the strip, parking at the hotel, and dealing with all the tourists is enough to keep me away.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	3	2015-02-16	0	0

I'd like to keep this review as clean as possible so look up reviews on Amazon regarding sugar-free Haribo gummy bears to give you a better idea of what actually went down.  If this were your first time, consider yourself warned and eat at your own risk!After hearing about the grueling wait in line for the past several days following its grand opening, we came in around 4 o'clock Sunday morning thinking there wouldn't be anyone in the establishment.  Instead, we walked in to one of the worst mistakes we've done in awhile.  To our surprise, the place itself was swarming with drunk people from nightclubs around the area.  It almost felt like a nightmare coming in sober; as if someone was about to get shot/stabbed at any moment.  At least you can get $1 beers from the bar right across the fast food joint to help you get acclimated with the whole scene if you happen to find yourself in the same situation.  We ended up waiting for over 50 minutes just to order and another 15 to get our food.  The sliders were just as good when I had it in Chicago.  For those having it for the first time, however, they're fairly similar from what you can get at Costco.  This might even be worse as they were rather cold once I started eating them.Overall, White Castle is definitely bringing in the masses for their infamous sliders.  As much as I'd like not to come back at this establishment, I can see my inebriated self lining up in the near future just to get a hold of their greasy sliders to help soak up the alcohol.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	2	2015-02-02	2	2

I was hoping that when I ate it fresh, it would taste better than the frozen ones you can buy at the supermarket... I was wrong, they taste the SAME. My friend warned me and told me it tastes like cardboard. I wouldn't go to that extreme, but I probably wouldn't go back. It's really not that cheap for small burgers and mediocre fries. If I'm comparing cheap fast food burgers, I prefer McDonalds.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	2	2015-06-25	0	0

11	HdrdiwMYkhWI49lmNPeziA	g0GuYEg-bCrNHMZViS_s0Q	I came to White Castle with my cousins who were excited to try it out as they had been to White Castle locations when they lived on the East Coast but could not find any of its locations in LA. The beauty of the strip is that you could be eating gourmet burgers from super star chefs one day and sliders from the freezer section of your local grocery store the next. As expected we ordered a bunch of stuff like original sliders, cheese sliders, onion rings, curly fries, chicken nuggets etc. The onion rings and chicken nuggets were outright nasty. Do yourself a favor and stay clear of those. The sliders specially the cheese slider was surprisingly very good. The buns were nice and soft without any sogginess. The pickles, cheese and patties came together very well. I chomped on six of these bad boys with ease so definitely order a bunch of them to fill you up.What I like about White Castle is that it does not try to be something that it is not. It is located opposite to one of the seediest dive bars that you will find on the strip and below a dumpy hotel both of which I have had the good fortune of sampling. Been there, done that, have no intention of repeating.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	4	2015-06-24	10	8

It's conveniently located on the strip to catch all the intoxicated folk walking by. It was pretty decent food, but I wasn't expecting the sliders to hold a thin sandwich like meat instead of an actual patty. Also, the fries were a bit too crispy for my liking.On the other hand, the service was pretty quick and I can't complain about what I ate after leaving the club--I was full at the end of the night, and that's really all the matters at the end of the that kind of night.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	3	2015-07-14	1	0

If you're walking the strip, you're been drinking and hungry then White Castle is a must! It's a newer spot on my way back to my hotel so I figured, why not? What you eat in Vegas, stays in Vegas. Since it's only sliders, I ordered a variety so that I can get my White Castle fix. My favorite was the Jalapeño Cheese Sliders. It wasn't spicy at all just in case you don't like spicy foods. The patty on the sliders are very thin and I recommend getting the doubles. White Castle has a nice twist of an onion ring with their Onion Chips. It wasn't bad and complimented the sliders well. The staff here is what you expect from a fast food restaurant but the customers are interesting. It ranges from the very drunk, drunk, families to completely sober people. Luckily they have ample tables and seating in their dining area. It could be cleaner but you have to option to take out. For me, I'm glad this experience stayed in Vegas.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	3	2017-03-28	22	22

We drove way too far for us to go back and ask for toppings on a burger, but who in the hell puts NOTHING on a burger!?**Edit: I ordered one sweet chili veggie burger and one ranch veggie burger.... Neither of which had anything but bread and a veggie pattie. Also, onions and pickles are vegan and come on all of your other burgers (FYI to the business owner who wanted to mention that cheese isn't vegan, as if this somehow remedies the situation or amounts to any sad excuse for customer service)**	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	1	2017-01-29	2	0

After waiting over 10 minutes to get our food, (which was to be expected as I learned from my first visit since they can be pretty busy at times) our fries were cold and stale. I was so hungry though that I ate my 5 sliders before going back up to the counter to tell them about the fries. The manager tells me """"you ordered almost 20 mins ago and now you tell me about the fries?...of course they're cold"""". Yeah we ordered 20 minutes ago, we hadn't had our food for 20 mins. I could not believe the audacity of this idiot. I told her they were cold and stale when she gave them to us and I wasn't going to argue with a fast food employee. As a manager she should've been accommodating especially since we just spent close to $30. I told her she could keep her fries, left them on the counter, and left.

Since we were staying on the strip for a 3 day staycation we planned on finally trying White Castle and cross it off our list. Personally I have had no urge to try this popular east coast chain but the hubby was adamant in trying it at least once. Ummmm NO, not going back. Lol. After trekking the unforgiving 110 degree Vegas heat from the Flamingo, we arrived at the very well lit White Castle space inside the Casino Royale. The area is decorated modestly and everywhere you looked was clean hence the extra star because reality is, all I can give for the quality food wise is 1 star.We ordered 2 cheese slider combos ($8.99 each) which consisted of: 4 cheese sliders, regular size fries and a drink; Large order of the onion chips ($2.99) the buy 'em by the sack which had 10 original sliders. All that set us back $32+ after the 10% local discount they gave us. The first couple of bites were okay but it was downhill after that, I had 3 sliders and I was fighting to down it. The middle was somewhat soggy which was very unsettling, the taste is indescribable but not in a good way. The fries and onion chips have nothing going on for them either, nothing to write home about. My daughter who likes cheeseburger barely finished one, my husband had the same sentiments, after his third one he was done. My son is the only one that liked it. I told him he can come with his cousins if the mood strikes him because there is no way you can ever bring me back here, it's just not worth the calories.

1	5XAXkk6WENi0OW_HSSXRWA	a0wXqSKjIG3Ww1yzAm27tA	"""I was real stoked to hear that White Castle opened up on the strip. And since we were gonna be in town for the big fight weekend, I was hyping up getting a crave case at some point during the weekend. Good thing it's open 24 hours but its location is a little tricky in that you really have to be in the immediate area and just walk over because it's smack dab in the middle of the strip by Harrah's and across the street from the Mirage... I was bummed to find out that this particular White Castle location does not offer the bacon-cheese slider or the jalapeno one. LAME. The bacon and cheese one is so good. Whenever one of my relatives flies to LA from Queens they bring a crave case of that goodness but none in Vegas?? That alone is worth the deduction of 2 stars.We got there after spending a few hours at Omnia nightclub and were all starving. Luckily the line wasnt too long. We only waited about 10-15 mins before we ordered. As soon as we sat down, the line was crazy... We ordered a crave case. That's 30 sliders. We got half classic and the other 15 with cheese. We got 4 orders of large fries and sodas. The sodas are refillable so that's good. The crinkle cut fries are decent. Some are crispy. Others were a little soggy. The sliders which I was so looking forward to were a little disappointing. Not because bacon wasnt an option but they just didnt taste as good as I remember. The weird thing was the original ones without the cheese were tastier than the ones WITH cheese. They seemed to have way more of the grilled/steamed onions on the originals than the cheese slider. The difference in taste was significant. And I was pretty disappointed... Dont get me wrong. I still scarfed down about 6 of them bad boys but I had no choice, I was starving. But I was still disappointed because I couldnt figure out how the sliders hand-carried on the plane ride from Queens and reheated in the microwave were better than the ones right off the grill in front of me. Puzzling... I hope it improves because if someone like me whose """"lightly"""" familiar with the White Castle menu is disappointed, what more for someone that's a tried & true Craver. Harold & Kumar would not approve...Funny story... As we were finishing up. A slightly tipsy and partied-out couple who didnt want to wait in the long line for their food offered us $10 for 2 sliders... SOLD. To the lush couple... Only in Vegas.Service was ok. Definitely no enthusiasm from the cashier that helped us. Theyre probably over it with the characters they see on the daily... Be better White Castle Las Vegas. You should be better than that.ps - cousins from Queens brought over a crave case a couple of weeks after this trip and sure enough, they were tastier. taste comparison complete... I was right.

2	ALw8EN21lby0vWtfD6JfIw	4QDH--0qaDk_DqHplhLJ2Q	I finally got to try this hype machine and meh is right!I've been wanting to check out White Castle ever since I saw the first Harold and Kumar movie. After my recent visit, its clear to me that you have to be stoned out of your mind to enjoy this place.Located in the decrepit Casino Royale, this White Castle is probably the main reason people even step inside this place. WC takes up a pretty big amount of real estate in the casino but don't expect to find seating or quick service. Being the only Castle on the West Coast means this place is packed; lines are long, service is poor and its not rare to see people fighting over a seat in the dining area. If you must come here, parking at Harrahs next door or Mirage across the street should be sufficiently close.The food here from my understanding is essentially the same as it's East Coast counter parts plus a few bucks cause you are eating on the Strip. The tiny sliders come with a paper thin slice of beef, a few grilled onions and a soggy bun due to the grease. The crinkle cut fries can be found at many other mediocre fast food spots. Skip the chicken rings and go buy some frozen nuggets from Costco, you will thank me later. The food is definitely over priced, a four slider combo with cheese runs for $9. Service was abysmal and place was a mess.While waiting in line, the party in front of us was talking about how they grew up on White Castle in New York and how excited they were to finally eat here again. I guess nostalgia must be the only way to really appreciate White Castle. Oh and maybe after smoking a bunch of weed.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	2	2015-02-17	2	2
1	eThMCu5Ipzi0L-Xs-lMhbw	cRtzGeVI704c_blx0hJovg	This is as good as it gets late night noshing. They don't look great, the location is small and weird right inside of the gross Casino Royale, everyone inside is plastered, and it just doesn't matter. When your number is called and those little boxes of heaven are handed over, all the pain in the world goes away and the most amazing flavor of deliciousness is all that matters.I suggest getting doubles; double the meat, double the cheese, double the fun! I just prefer the extra meat and gooey cheese to bun ratio better than the singles. I also prefer the jalapeno cheeseburgers to the regular ones. It is not a spicy jalapeno flavor at all, just a little kick to let you know it's there. Just an added bonus for who like a little spice.There's not much more to say. If you're looking for a gourmet burger, this is not it. But if it's late, you've lost some money at the tables, and you just want something delicious to chomp on, this is the place. The lines can get long, but who cares? It's Vegas. Grab a drink and relax. What are you in such a hurry for anyway?SIDE STORY: My wife got hit on right in front of me and I still didn't care.

My boyfriend and I came around 11 PM after watching a show since we knew the wait during the day would just be ridiculous. Thankfully we were right and the line was pretty short (25 mins) compared to what other people experienced. The line starts outside on the sidewalk and is pretty well manned and serviced by security guys. On to the food. I wasn't that hungry but my boyfriend decided to """"Buy 'em by the sack"""" since this is probably the last time we would be coming here unless we were super drunk and stumbled down this way again. The menu says 10 original sliders but they will put cheese on as many of them as you like which costs you a bit extra. We also got extra grilled onions (which can be added for free). The crinkle cut fries were good but don't think they were any different than ones you get from other fast food joints (just a bit more soggy). The sliders with the cheese were definitely better. They may not seem that big but you can tell you are just putting a whole load of grease down into your stomach.Onto the aftermath of eating those sliders...man what are those things actually made of! The next morning I was soooooo gassy! So I'm not sure what those tiny little meat patties are made of or how much oil and grease is used to make the burger but man that was noooot pleasant. All in all I probably won't be coming back anytime soon, at least not sober. It's definitely a place to try just because of it's notoriety from the east coast but don't wait in line if it's over 30 minutes! You will be disappointed!"""	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	2	2015-02-06	3	1

After that, I noticed that you could buy them frozen in the supermarket and defrost them to get a fix. When I heard an actual location opened up in Vegas, I made it a point to get there eventually. It took me 3 trips to Vegas to finally go because I was scared away by the potential crowds.Well, it finally happened. It's located on the outskirts of Casino Royale on the strip, really easy to find by foot.I came on a Wednesday around 11 am. There was a very short line but the seating area was pretty full. I asked the cashier when it starts getting crazy, and she told me after noon. A hot tip for you guys, earlier is better. The service was great, and the seating area was clean.I ordered ten sliders with cheese, onion rings, and fries. The fried stuff was meh but the sliders were delicious. Meat, cheese, onion, and a soft roll. They taste better than the frozen ones because they're cooked fresh. The difference isn't that noticeable though. Verdict: I love their sliders. I don't care that they're mostly bread with very little meat. I'm not coming here to be healthy. Note: They have cheesecake on a stick. I regret not getting it. They also sell beer.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	4	2016-05-20	11	11

Food was prepared quick. I ordered the double slider, cheese slider, and a fish slider. Size is your typical small slider size; smaller than a McDonalds. The food was just plain. Your bun, cheese, meat, pickles, onions? and that's it. If there was sauce, I couldn't taste it. Good thing they offered condiments like ketchup, mayo, mustard, ranch, honey mustard, BBQ sauce, zesty sauce, hot sauce, etc. Mayo went well with the fish slider I got. Honey mustard went well with the double slider. All in all, I was a little disappointed in the taste. I don't want to have to add my own sauce...

Grease-drenched, bland flavors reign supreme here, so no matter what you get you won't care for it much. The long lines, and the smoke stench that linger into the dining room from the casino floor, makes the experience really sub-par.

They call those burgers that was the thinnest piece of meat I have ever seen. Not only did the food taste nasty but almost made me want to throw up so I can rid myself from the horrible taste that haunted my mouth after the food that I tried to eat from there. What a Waste of money.  Not only that but it took way too long to get my food and the constant yelling of numbers made the atmosphere unbearable. First time here at this place and definitely will be my last time. You have been warned: don't ever eat here!	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	1	2016-10-24	1	1

I've been to multiple locations on the east coast, and wish they would come to Cali, but Vegas is close enough for now.Having the cheeseburgers made fresh are 20x better than the frozen ones. Hands down, my favorite tasting fast food cheeseburger. I love the Hawaiian style sweet bread for a bun, the grilled chopped onions, the juicy flavor of the meat and the melted cheese. The chicken was juicy and tender and the breading was a little crunchy. Mmmmmm so good for a quick bite to eat. Many people come here to try the burgers and complain that they are small. Duhhh, they are called cravings because they are small slider type mini burgers. Either way, I love their burgers, and am glad to see a closer location. This location has beer, soda, donuts, fries, burgers with and w/out cheese, and chicken sandwiches. The line was long when I arrived, but moved really quick. The food was ready within 4 minutes and there was plenty of seats inside. We enjoyed our food before we continued walking, and took the 4 cheeseburgers we had left for later. Whenever I am in Vegas, you can guarantee I will stop by.	dKdApYVFDSNYsNOso6NYlA	5	2016-04-06	3	5
